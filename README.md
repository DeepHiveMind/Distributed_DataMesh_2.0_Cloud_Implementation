# Distributed Data Mesh 2.0 

> DataMesh-as-a-Code on Cloud | Curated list of Data Mesh Artefacts.



**[Data Mesh]** is a new paradigm to data architecture that follows 5 main principles: 
1. Domain-oriented data and compute 
2. Data as a product
3. Self-serve data platform (Data-as-a-Service)
4. Federated computational governance
5. Service Mesh powered Data Governance & Data Management
