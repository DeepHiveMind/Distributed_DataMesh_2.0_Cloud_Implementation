# Enterprise Data MESH journey :airplane: *from Theory to Practice*

- This repository is my [*@DeepHiveMind*](https://DeepHiveMind.io) humble contribution to the Open Source Community for **The Best of Enterprise Data Mesh 2.0** by introducing the Constructs, Design Elements, Real life implementations of Data Mesh, Codesets, Data Mesh Reference Artefacts & FAQs from the captivating landscape of Distributed Data Mesh 2.0. 

- üí° Many enterprises are investing in their next generation data hub, with the hope of democratizing data at scale to provide business insights and ultimately make automated intelligent decisions. Data platforms based on the data lake architecture have common failure modes that lead to unfulfilled promises at scale. To address these failure modes we need to shift from the *centralized paradigm of a lake, or its predecessor data warehouse*. üí° We need to shift to a paradigm that draws from *modern distributed architecture: considering domains as the first class concern, applying platform thinking to create self-serve data infrastructure, and treating data as a product*. üí° Data Mesh paradigm reduces overall friction for information flow in the organization, where the producer is responsible for the datasets they produce and is accountable to the consumer based on the advertised SLAs.

- To Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake/ Centralized LakeHouse / Data Warehouse to a Distributed Data Mesh paradigm is a JOURNEY. :airplane:

- Welcome onaboard to **The Universe of "Distributed Data Mesh 2.0!"**.

## What is Enterprise Data MESH?

- "A Data Mesh is a paradigm shift in how we think about building data platforms. 
The architecture is the convergence of Distributed Domain Driven Architecture, Self-serve Platform Design and Product Thinking with Data". 
-- Zhamak Dehghani, Thoughtworks

- Data Mesh is a new/modern Data Platform paradigm to *DOMAIN-ORIENTED + DATA-PRODUCT + SELF-SERVE DATA Infra PLATFORM + FEDERATED GOVERNANCE + DECENTRALIZED TOPOLOGY* driven modern distributed data architecture that conforms to
			[A] the certain defined [Architecture Principles as detailed in below section](#architecture-principles-of-enterprise-data-mesh) and
			[B] the tenets, such as:  
				(i) Considering Domains as the first class concern,  
				(ii) Applying Platform thinking to create Self-Serve Data Infrastructure, and  
				(iii) Treating Data as a Product with
				(iv) Federated Governance

- 'Distributed Data Mesh 2.0' is an advancement of Data Mesh Architectural paradigm with [advanced Data Mesh Topologies](#data-mesh-topology-patterns) across Multi/Hybrid Cloud.

<br>
Attention:

	1. The paradigm shift in Distributed Data Architecture with domain driven ownership comes with several nuances and consideration. 
	Implmentation of Data Mesh architecture in any enterprise mostly depends on 
	(a) organizational maturity and skills, 
	(b) organizational structure, 
	(c) risk appetite, 
	(d) sizing and dynamics. 
	
	2. Data Mesh has a concrete set of principles (most importantly a set of ideas). Physcializing those ideas to practice by building out mesh is a JOURNEY.
	
	3. There may not be an obvious THRESHOLD to measure the Data Mesh industrialization. i.e., it's a Continuum of Care (CoC).
	
	4. While Data Mesh allows much more room to flex and scale, as every other paradigm, shouldn‚Äôt be considered as a perfect-fit solution for every single scenario. As with all decentralised data architectures, there are a few common challenges. Please refer below to the sub-topic [The Challenges of Data Mesh] for further insight. 
	
<br>

#### The Domain-driven Goal of DATA MESH

- **A cloud distributed data mesh, which allows DOMAIN-SPECIFIC data and treats ‚ÄúDATA-as-a-PRODUCT‚Äù**. 
- :bulb: **Enabling each DOMAIN to handle its own DATA-PIPELINES**. This is different from plumbing data from the traditional (monolithic) platforms that generally tightly couple and often slow down the ingestion, storage, transformation, and consumption of data from one central data lake or hub.
- :bulb: Therefore, Data Mesh paradigm objective is to reduce overall friction for information flow in the organization, where the **data producer is responsible for the datasets they produce and is accountable to the consumer based on the advertised SLAs**.
- **Move away from tightly coupled data interfaces and varying data flows towards an architecture that allows eco-system connectivity**.

###### To be an integral part of Data Mesh OSS Community, Please be conversant with **[Data Mesh as defined by Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html)**

## Why DATA MESH Architecture/Model/Paradigm?
#### DRIVERS OF DATA MESH

:bulb: Let us explore Why to move away from 'CENTERAL DATA PLATFORM' Architectue to 'DATA MESH Paradigm based DATA PLATFORM' (Decentralized Domain Oriented Data Product, powered by Topologies for Decentralized Data-Product Node governance with Self-serve Data Infra)? 

		Answer of the aforementioned Question lies is in 3 STEP PROCESS - 
			- STEP 1: Let's first acknowledge {The Beauty of 'Central Data Platform'}
			- STEP 2: Let's then explore { The Challenge/ Bottleneck with 'Central Data Platform' }
			- STEP 3: Let's then find out solution in { 'Data Mesh as Solution'}

- STEP 1: *The Beauty of 'Central Data Platform'*:
 
Organizations of all sizes have recognized that data is one of the key enablers to increase and sustain innovation, and drive value for their customers and business units. They are eagerly modernizing traditional data platforms with cloud-native technologies that are highly scalable, feature-rich, and cost-effective. A centralized model is intended to
		[a] simplify staffing and training by centralizing data and technical expertise in a single place, 
		[b] to reduce technical debt by managing a single data platform, and
		[c] to reduce operational costs.



- STEP 2: *The Challenge/ Bottleneck with 'Central Data Platform'*: 

Managing data through a Central Data Platform can create following multi-dimensional challenges, (as central teams may not understand the specific needs of a data domain, whether due to data types and storage, security, data catalog requirements, or specific technologies needed for data processing.) --

		 [a] scaling, 
		 [b] ownership,
		 [c] accountability challenges,
		 
		 [d] Huge backlog -- 
		 'Central Data platform' pattern works for smaller organizations and organizations that have a high degree of centralization from a team setup perspective. However, using only a single team often creates a bottleneck in larger organizations. This bottleneck causes a huge backlog, with parts of an organization having to wait for data integration services and Analytical solutions. 
		
		[e] Organizations adopting MODERN DATA SCIENCE solutions --
		Many modern data science solutions require more data than traditional business intelligence solutions did in the past. It creates a huge backlog and depedencies on central Data platform team. 
		
		[f] Organizations are DECENTRALIZED and DISTRIBUTED from a business perspective -- 
		Most organizations are decentralized and distributed from a business perspective. Having a single team handling all of data ingestion on a single platform in a large organization can also be problematic. One team rarely has experts for every data source.
		
		[g] Microservices as an Application development pattern for Business Transcation Processing Source System -- 
		The recent switch to using microservices as an application development pattern is another driver of long backlogs around data integration because it increases the number of data sources.

- STEP 3: *'Data Mesh as Solution'*:
 
These challenges can often be reduced by **giving ownership and autonomy to the team who owns the data, best allowing them to build data products, rather than only being able to use a common central data platform**. 
Data Mesh paradigm is the solution as it supports all the constructs to make it work. As

:bulb: For instance, product teams (in E-Commerce/ e-shop) are responsible for ensuring the product inventory is updated regularly with new products and changes to existing ones. They‚Äôre the domain experts of the product inventory datasets. If a discrepancy occurs, they‚Äôre the only group who knows how to fix it. :bulb: Therefore, they‚Äôre best candidates to implement and operate a technical solution to ingest, process, and produce the product inventory dataset. Data Mesh paradigm and Architecture enables the domain team to perform and own these activities.

:bulb: With the Data Mesh, The E-Commerce/e-shop 'product team' owns everything leading up to the data being consumed: they choose the technology stack, operate in the mindset of data as a product, enforce security and auditing, and provide a mechanism to expose the data to the organization in an easy-to-consume way.

:bulb: Data MESH paradigm is based on Architectural framework which infuses Microservices as an application development pattern for the MODERN DISTRIBUTED DECNETRALIZED DATA PLATFORM. 

:bulb: Therefore, Data Mesh paradigm reduces overall friction for information flow in the organization, where the **data producer is responsible for the datasets they produce and is accountable to the consumer based on the advertised SLAs**.

## Architecture Principles of Enterprise Data MESH

**[Data Mesh as defined by Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html)** is a new paradigm to DOMAIN-ORIENTED + DATA PRODUCT + SELF-SERVE DATA Infra + DECENTRALIZED TOPOLOGY data architecture that conforms to the following main Architecture Principles, such as: 

	1. Domain Oriented DECENTRALIZATION
		a. Domain-oriented Data compute  
		b. Domain-oriented Data Stoarge  
		c. Domain-oriented Data pipeline
		d. Domain-oriented Data Model 

	2. Data-as-a-Product
		# DATA PRODUCT is a function of Data platform governed by MICROSERVICE GOVERNANCE & SERVICE MESH for self-discoverable, resilient, secured and performant for data domain services
	
		# Caveat: DATA PRODUCT & SERVICES are not defined by the size of the function, but instead by the context, cohesion and coupling, requiring either orchestration (Service) or choreography (Micro-Service) to mediate between Services  
	
	3. Self-serve Infra for data platform (DataInfra-as-a-Service)

	4. Centeralized Data Governance  
		a. Centralized Data Provenance (Domain Data Data catalogue, Data Protection and PII Anonymization, Data Lienage, Enterprise MDM 360, et al)  
		b. Unified Policy Management  
		c. Unified Data Virtualization Service  
		d. Federated Data Access Control Service  
		e. Organization wide Secured Data Sharing

	5. DATA MESH Topology (DECENTRALIZED Topology to power DataMesh NODE PATTERN)
		a. Governed Data Mesh topology  
		b. Harmonized Data Mesh topology  
		c. Highly federated Data Mesh topology
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

## The challenges of Data Mesh

While Data Mesh allows much more room to flex and scale, as every other paradigm, shouldn‚Äôt be considered as a perfect-fit solution for every single scenario. As with all decentralised data architectures, there are a few common challenges, including:

- Ensuring that toolsets and approaches are unified (where applicable) across teams.
- Harmonising data and unifying presentation. A user that reads interconnected data across several data products should be able to map it correctly.
- Making data products easy to find and understand, through a comprehensive documentation process.
- Establishing consistent monitoring, alerting and logging practices.
- Safeguarding data access controls, especially where a many-to-many relationship exists between data products.
- Minimise the duplication of workload and data between different teams; centralised data management is often incredibly hard to implement company-wide.

<br>
<br>

## Data Fabric vs Data Mesh

- A data fabric and a data mesh both provide an architecture to access data across multiple technologies and platforms, a data fabric is technology-centric, while a data mesh focuses on organisational change.

- Data fabric connects data from multiple sources and prepares it in a way in which you ‚Äì a business user or a data professional ‚Äì can access and analyse it easily. Think about it like putting a big blanket around your architecture to easily access what you need from the outside of the blanket. 
Whereas, the Data Mesh paradigm stands for decentralised and domain-specific data ownership that is easily discoverable and ready for consumption for everyone in the organisation via a Marketplace.

			According to *Gartner*, data fabric is a design concept that serves as an integrated layer (fabric) of data and connecting processes. It is a composable, flexible and scalable way to maximize the value of data in an organization. It‚Äôs not one tool or process, rather an emerging design concept that gives a framework to think about how to stack existing tools, resources, and processes.
		
- Data mesh moves away from the concept of storing, transforming, and processing analytical data centrally. Instead, it advocates that each business domain is responsible for hosting, preparing, and serving their data to their own domain and larger audience.
