# Connecting through ksqlDB CLI

This recipe will show how to connect throught the CLI to ksqlDB. 

## Initialise data platform

First [initialise a platys-supported data platform](../documentation/getting-started) with the following services enabled

```bash
platys init --enable-services KAFKA,KAFKA_KSQLDB -s trivadis/platys-modern-data-platform -w 1.9.1
```

Optionally you can increase the number of ksqlDB server instances by adding the following property to the `config.yml` generated in the previous step.

```
KAFKA_KSQLDB_nodes: 2
```

Now set an environment variable to the home folder of the dataplatform and generate and then start the data platform. 

```bash
export DATAPLATFORM_HOME=${PWD}

platys gen

docker-compose up -d
```

## Connect through the CLI

To connect over the CLI, we use the `ksqldb-cli` docker container and connect to the `ksqldb-server-1` container, which is running the ksqlDB server, possibly with other servers if have increased the number of nodes in `KAFKA_KSQLDB_nodes` property in the `config.yml`. 

```bash
docker exec -it ksqldb-cli ksql http://ksqldb-server-1:8088
```

you should see an output similar to the one below

```
docker exec -it ksqldb-cli ksql http://ksqldb-server-1:8088
