# StreamSets Transformer Engine

StreamSets TransformerTM is an execution engine that runs data processing pipelines on Apache Spark, an open-source cluster-computing framework. Because Transformer pipelines run on Spark deployed on a cluster, the pipelines can perform transformations that require heavy processing on the entire data set in batch or streaming mode.
