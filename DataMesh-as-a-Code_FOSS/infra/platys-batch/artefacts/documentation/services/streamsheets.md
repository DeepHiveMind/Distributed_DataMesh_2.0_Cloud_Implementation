# Streamsheets

Streamsheets are server-based spreadsheets that consume, process and produce data streams. Data streams can originate from many sources, such as sensors, machines, websites, data bases, applications and many more. How incoming data streams are processed, analysed, visualized and combined as well as which outgoing data streams are produced is modelled entirely with spreadsheet formulas and especially without writing a single line of program code.
