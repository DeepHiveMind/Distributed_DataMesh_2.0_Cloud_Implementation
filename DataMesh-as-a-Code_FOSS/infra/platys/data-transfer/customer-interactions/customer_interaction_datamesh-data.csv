We did the only reasonable thing and dumped DirecTV in favor of Cable and the new Tivo HD DVR box. Great picture, great on-screen guide, handy hard drive capacity expandability, and it does everything we want. We don't miss VOD and PPV, as we have all the download features availble to our Tivo box through our high speed DSL connection.

With all of that useless info being said, I absolutely love this phone. When I felt the loose battery covery I hardly cared after playing around with the OS for a day. It is very responsive and does not lag nearly as much as the older models. I have not had to reset the phone once and I have had it since monday (today is thursday).. My biggest gripe is the fact that RIM decided to place the microphone on the bottom of the speaker which definitely causes a slight muffle to my voice going out.

18244,820,"5 out of 5 FANTASTIC STRESS-REDUCER Monday, January 21, 2008. addictedtoGarmin from NYC and upstate NY. I love this unit. This is my first GPS and I read tons of reviews to choose one. I went back and forth between this and the Tomtom 910T... but this one won. I wish I had the Tomtom voice control destination entry option (the only negative on this unit is having to enter the addresses), but this unit keeps the past addresses, so its really easy to access them once entered. I have it set to Daniel, the brit, and we have our arguments (its nice to have a navigating verbal companion). Daniel, although insistent about turning at times will readjust and offer me a new path. He offers me options along the way and always warns of turns in plenty of time. He tells me about a turn way in advance, tells me how long I will travel on this road, and then reminds me of the turn right before the turn. He even tells you which lane the exit will be in. So all the turns and exits are relaxed. The turn is also listened in advance at the top of the screen in large type (along with useful things such as the speed limit and time). You can just enjoy the ride without navigating. I travel backroads in the dark (with Mapquest I was reading my papers while driving - not good!) The routes chosen are excellent and the unit readjusts immediately if you missed the turn or you are taking another path. Its not turn-around-you-idiot... he (or the unit) offers the next idea and turn. I'm so impressed and addicted. Can't go anywhere without it!.",9000,2013-11-01T21:27:32Z

I have 20/20 vision but LCD's have been giving me eyestrain as long as I can remember (and before that CRT's were even worse). This screen is primarily a computer monitor for me which I sit 4 feet from and is mounted on a wall behind my desk. I can stare at this thing for 12 hours straight with no eyestrain. I dont know if its because its at a further distance from my eyes than a standard monitor or because of the LED lighting. Regardless, this TV has the downright best picture quality Ive ever seen. For some reason alot of the TV's features are disabled in PC or DVI/ PC mode yet it is still the best looking computer monitor Ive ever used. Its colors look alot cooler and more realistic than my unrealistically warmer colored S-IPS panel which I upgraded from.. This TV has serious input lag. Id say the input lag may be as high as 100ms. This is a serious problem for gamers. I am a gamer, and almost returned the TV. The image quality was so good though that I just couldnt go back to my old S-IPS 26 computer monitor. Ive decided to live with the lag and enjoy the screen. The lag isnt bad enough to make games unplayable, I still play first person shooters and do just fine but its nowhere near the instantaneous response like on my old computer monitor.. This TV is awesome. It has the best picture Ive ever seen, and no eyestrain at all. If you're a competetive gamer like me, I would think twice about dealing with the serious input lag this TV has. Its really not that bad, and non competetive gamers wont even notice the lag. But if youre competitive you may want a TV with no input lag.

Sorry Nikon, but Canon still has a lead in the Pro DSLR segment.

The 1DMK3 performs at top speed with all features active, the Nikon D3 cheats to achieve full speed.. The most visible difference is seen in the quality of the final image. The 1DMK3 is sharper at every ISO, with noise just as well controlled. Highlight Tone Priority gives the 1DMK3 a 1-stop advantage in dynamic range... that's a big deal..

(I use it with HP zv5000 us).. It comes with SA2005, which is so poor:. 1. No detail on most of the area I interested in (but MS ST does).So it come with feature that you can add street and route if you want. I can add 10 streets in my home town but you cannot add every downtown street you just drive by. I have to work on MS ST to find the point coords then enter into SA, so I would not miss the point too far. Why not use it with ST, because the GPS has difficulty to connect ST though both manufactures say they are nmea 0183 compliance.. 2. All your map mark is not searchable.. 3. Confusible conception on Add/Insert Via/Stop..... 4. Access manu command is hard. Most of them are level 2 even 3 and 4. You can eazily get lost from where you are come from. I tried rember the back manu button but soon forget it in your next trip if you use it once in a month.. 5. Forget the voice command function it is for fun. And premature. (This feature really attract me before I bought but soon you'll find it is useless).. 6. Poor position accuracy and data filtering: Delorme display track called breadcrumble, it is too wide and will interfere your reading of highway switch. MS ST looks better than Delorme SA. Stay somewhere for while, ST has much less fast position data drafting.. Recommand spending little bit more rather than waste money in this way. Bought Handhold GPS+ MS ST.

13684,766,"I love all of the features it offers. I've owned this camera since November of 2007. Just recently, our house flooded. Well, I was inclined to take pictures for insurance purposes, but when I couldn't find the date/time stamp in the options, I was highly confused. I went online to the Canon support site and could not find anything about it. So, I randomly Googled my problem and came up with a whole bunch of pages and reviews complaining about there not being a date/time stamp.. I love the camera though, even without the date/time stamp. It is very reliable and doesn't drain batteries as fast as a lot of my cheaper cameras. The zoom and speed shot features are, by far, my favorites. I have really shaky hands due to nerve damage, and to be able to catch a picture that's not blurry is a miracle. The neck strap is a good feature too, because of my hands. Although, I have dropped it a few times here and there, it hasn't given me any problems, other than restarting. It is a very sturdy camera and very easy to clean the lense. Before today, I would have given it a 5, but I just can't because of that one flaw. Sorry Canon!.

5581,984,"This camera is brilliant. It's my first dSLR, and while I don't have anything to compare it too, I wouldn't choose any other entry-level SLR on the market. It's been available for a long time now, which means you can get it for a great price. Despite being a number of years old, the quality of the camera matches brand-new beginner SLR that cost twice as much or more.. The image quality of this camera is astounding. Misinformed consumers might think that 6 megapixels is not enough, but I think it's perfect. In fact, because there are fewer megapixels than newer cameras, each individual pixel is more accurate and better quality. This also means that higher ISO levels turn out better as well. The only disadvantage of 6 megapixels is that the images cannot be blown up as big.. Nikons are known for their unmatched ergonomics, and this camera is no exception. It feels great to hold and it's light in weight so it's easy to carry around. The menus are also great and easy to navigate for beginners, but there are also plenty of advanced options for more experienced photographers.. The only real complaint I have is the lack of auto-bracketing, which I'd find very useful and it would be fun to experiment with HDR photography. It can still be done but it's just a bit harder to do manually. 3 autofocus points isn't that much of an issue because I always compose my shot before I take a photo anyway, but people using this camera for action photography (which I wouldn't recommend for this camera anyway) might find this to be a drawback. The only other negative, a reasonably slow burst of 2.5fps, will only apply to action photographers as well, so it doesn't really bother me.. Overall, a great beginner SLR or a good secondary camera for professionals (from what I've heard). The image quality is great, and the positives far outweigh the negatives..",28000,2011-01-16T11:32:54Z

So the fwd or rew during play, you can't advance the movie faster viewing the all the sequences of the scenes, just in segments of seconds (10,15 etc) so is hard to search a specific part of a scene.. I think this technology is too young or the factories are stealing our money puting new features (new?) little by little so you have to buy a new model every year. Is bizarre that you can't play slow motion in 2009. There is no sense.. I read that the Panasonic Blu-ray is the only player that it has that features..",29000,2012-09-25T08:03:24Z

Pictures and movies look terrific on this screen. I'm glad they kept the screen size and put it into this very small and slim player, it makes it more pocket-friendly.. As expected from Creative, it has an array of features. It also supports AAC now, but I don't have those so I didn't really need it, but I know most people do. It supports many types of files which is great since you don't have to convert every single file into one file type. I've never had a problem with the program it comes with since it's pretty easy to use.. And something new from Creative, the SD card slot. I've never used those before, but they've proved to be quite handy for extra memory....not that 16GB isn't enough for me. I'm good with even just 4 or 8GB but just in case. I do watch a lot of anime shows so it was perfect for viewing those.. Oh and it has great battery life. One charge and I was listening and watching for two days. GREAT.. It is pretty affordable when you think about all the things that the player comes with and all its capabilities. I mean, I got this from Circuit City for about $170 (more or less) and that's really good for a 16GB player with this many features.. So I highly highly highly HIGHLY recommend this. I don't know how much I can stress it but it's absolute genius. I mean, unless you hate the controls, which I thought were good and pretty straightforward.

The only issues that I had with it were the ones listed next to the Cons above.. Such as the Picture Quality: Flash is okay, but sometimes it adds too much contrast into a picture, but it's hardly ever blurry. Flash also delays for about three seconds--maybe longer--before it actually takes a picture, which is undoubtedly frustrating. Without Flash on, the pictures can come out blurry unless you have it on the proper ISO setting. Make sure you have a steady hand.. The problem with the videos is pretty minor. It doesn't take up too much space as long as it's a minute or less and the battery doesn't wear out too much faster. The video con was really just a warning..

20367,966,i love this mp3 mainly because the mp3 has awesome video and audio quality!!!!ibought it for $99.99 at best buy(4gb)it is a great and a small mp3 AND Its worth the price!!!!the only thing that i hated was that i had to pay $12.95 for the video software to convert video into mp4 plus it takes a really long time for the video to convert!!!but thats my only grip (sony should really just include the software you need when you purchase the mp3!!!).,46000,2013-04-20T01:01:00Z

The looks of this unit are awesome, if you have a darker theme'd room then this TV will definatly fit right on (as is the case with my room). The picture quality is amazing, but i dont have much to compare it to as this is my first HDTV, but i can see how cnet says it is amazing cause side by side at bestbuy their is no comparison.. The main selling point for me that i found in this TV was the price, at about $2500 canadian MSRP (you can find it for like $2200 if you look around) it is a steal. I honestly cant get over how some TV's still get away with a huge markup for canada (cough westinghouse cough), so if your canadian this is definaly a TV to be considering..",47000,2012-10-01T16:52:17Z

9085,322,"I have held off jumping into writing a review of the iPhone 3G deliberately because of all the euphoria and hype surrounding its launch you can so easily get carried away with it, so now nearly 3 weeks after getting my hands on one it is time to share my thoughts on the good the bad and the ugly sides of this years most anticipated phone.. Externally. From the outside there are hardly any differences to the untrained eye, looking a bit closer, the switches on the left hand side of the phone are now metal and the rear of the iPhone 3G is now all plastic instead of the much classier looking aluminium of the previous incarnation. The rear of the phone is the only stand out difference and it can be had in a black finish on the 8 Gig and 16 Gig versions and all white in the 16 Gig flavour only. The plastic is not a cheap type of plastic but does look very nice although it attracts finger prints. The back is also curved as the iPhone 3G is slightly fatter but the way the rear is tapered it is very hard to tell that this is the case.. Everything else appears to be the same from the outside including screen size and resolution, however the external speakers have definitely been beefed up as listening to music with them is much louder and clearer than the original iPhone model, I tested this last night with two identical songs playing and the iPhone 3G totally drowned out the original iPhone and was still crystal clear where the latter was distorted.. Whats all the hype about this 3G then ?. Well as the iPhone is a connected internet phone in all senses, 3G is a major addition to the device, to get the most from the iPhone involves web surfing, email gathering and many other data intensive tasks happening quickly, over Edge or GPRS this was at best slow but mostly painful, over WiFi it was a great experience. Now imagine having a WiFi connection with you all the time and that is what 3G can give you, once you have it, you cannot give it up, its fantastic. I did a few speed tests and I was getting some pretty fast speeds as you can see below, the downside is 3G coverage is by no means brilliant and can be very patchy but when it is available it works great.. Onboard GPS. Another new feature of the iPhone 3G is integrated GPS, you know the technology that powers TomTom and other satellite navigation systems to give you turn by turn directions to where you need to get too, unfortunately it does not work like this as of yet on the iPhone 3G, what you do have is a very accurate GPS chip that on average pin points you to within 10 feet of where you are, you can then use this with various social networking tools to show your location, handy yes but not really what we need GPS for. The other option is to run it with the Google Maps application. This application needs a connection to the internet as it downloads the map data on the fly and does a great job, but again no turn by turn navigation or voice prompts so for me the GPS in the iPhone is not very good at all. It is a wasted bit of technology and we do not know if we will ever see a proper application to offer what full GPS should be. Google maps does fill in some of the blanks but on my visit to France if I used it, it would have cost hundreds of pounds in roaming data charges just to see where I was going. For now a separate TomTom is still needed so a big cross next to GPS for now.. Battery Life. Having the 3G and GPS switched on totally blows your battery, I think it has come as a big shock to people who havent used a 3G device before, but be prepared to charge your device every day and probably more often than that. When you first get the iPhone 3G give it at least a weeks worth of charges and discharges before panicking as the battery needs to work its way up to full capacity. If you are in a weak 3G area the phone will be constantly switching between 3G and GPRS \ Edge coverage which can really eat the battery, I would suggest turning 3G off in this case and only switching it on when you need it, Apple really should have had easy access to this with an on screen icon or even an on/off switch similar to the ringer switch, this would have been a great addition, same for GPS too. Once you are conditioned to how the battery performs you will be able to live with it, although for me a car charger is a necessity.. Compatibility with previous iPhone accessories. The only difference hardware wise that will cause problems with older accessories is that Apple have removed the pins from the iPhone 3G that allowed charging via FireWire. Not a big problem you might think but a lot of manufacturers actually used this charging method in docks and especially car integration kits as it worked on 12V and the USB pins work on 5V. I have a Dension Gateway 100 which charged my original iPhone and transferred music to the car speakers through the iPhone dock port, when I connect my iPhone 3G to the kit, it will not charge but does work for transferring the music, not a great solution due to the battery problems already mentioned. Dension are working on a replacement model but this means spending more money on a new system.. The next parts cover the iPhone 2.0 software, which is available on the iPhone 3G and the original iPhone through a software upgrade via iTunes.. The App Store. The App Store is a breath of fresh air, we all know about the iPhone SDK and what it would bring, well here are the fruits, either downloading through iTunes or over the air Apps are now available for either version of the iPhone. At launch and up to this point however it has to be said they are nothing to write home about, sure on the application side we have a few decent Twitter Apps, talking language phrase books and quite a few totally useless applications but nothing substantial. I think it is totally unfair to judge the iPhone platform at this stage on the Apps that are available, Windows Mobile fans have jumped on the limitations of the App Store and I agree in comparison at this stage it is inferior, but give it 6 months and I believe we will see a lot more useful applications and a lot from the big mobile software houses to push the iPhone into the big league.. Games wise the iPhone is going to be an important platform, at launch we already have Super Monkey Ball and Crash Nitro Kart, both of these games show the power of the iPhone and what we can expect in the future and that is a great gaming platform without a doubt.. Now the downside, Apple have made the iPhone App Store a closed shop, in other words without their approval you cannot get an application out, great we thought this will ensure the quality of the applications and prevent the problems we have seen with Windows Mobile, like system freezes and regular soft resets, well from my experience this is not the case, running firmware version 1.4 even jailbroken with a few third party applications I never had to reset my iPhone, since the 2.0 firmware I am resetting at least once every few days and in between I am thrown out of applications back to the home screen regularly, it is not the greatest experience so far and needs to improve, maybe Apple rushed a few things out so they would have some applications available at launch. The good news is, if you buy an application or download one of the many free applications and there is an update available then it shows up straight away and you are able to update it straight from the iPhone or through iTunes, nothing like that is available on Windows Mobile.. Which brings us nicely round to how Apps are installed on the iPhone, two options are available. The first via iTunes on a Mac or PC, you can browse the App Store exactly how you would the music store, the software is categorised and easily searched through, click an App you would like to install, download it then just sync your iPhone as normal and thats it. If you want too, you can also just load up the APP Store on your iPhone home screen and again you are given various options to find applications by category or search by name or description. The Apps can be downloaded and installed over the air by cellular network or WiFi but there is a limit on size for his method, any App over 10 MB must be sourced through the iTunes store on a Mac or PC. To uninstall Apps you can just delete them as normal on the iPhone home screen or removed them from iTunes and sync, it is as simple as that. It really is a seamless experience.. Exchange Activesync. If you have ever used a Windows Mobile device with an exchange server then you will be well aware of how good Activesync works over the air, dont be fooled for one moment that this has anything to do with the horrendous Windows program for the PC as it doesnt thank god. This is the service that allows full push email, which means when an email arrives in your exchange email account it is automatically pushed straight to your iPhone, I have tested this since day one and it works absolutely perfectly. Add to this contact and calendar synchronisation too and it really becomes a fantastic solution. You put a new contact into your iPhone when you are out and about and it immediately is pushed to your exchange account so when you get home, fire up outlook on your Mac or PC and its there in your contacts already. Similarly appointments, two way sync and no need for any docking or cable connections, a brilliant addition to the iPhone firmware.. If you do not have an exchange account they are a couple of alternatives, the first being a hosted account through a company like 4Smartphone or Apple themselves are offering a service called MobileMe which is supposed to offer exchange like functionality for a yearly cost. The latter has suffered with a few teething problems so far so it would be worth reading up on these before making any commitments.. Calculator. The calculator Application has had a bit of a makeover too, it looks the same in vertical mode, but turn the iPhone to a horizontal position and calculator flips to reveal a full scientific calculator, very smart.. Safari. Not a lot of changes with the Safari browser although it does seem to render pages much faster now and has the added ability to save images which we never had before, but we still can not view any flash animations or videos within Safari, click a Youtube link for example and Safari is left behind and the Youtube video will play in the specific software player, a bit of a shame as it is touted as having the Full Internet.. Screenshots. As standard we can now take screen shots and save them directly to the Camera Roll in pictures, simply hold down the home button and press the top on/off button and the screen will go blank then return and then you have the screen shot, a handy feature.. Camera. Nothing physical has changed, it is still the lowly 2 megapixel lense although Apple do claim to have improved the quality through software, I havent noticed any change and if you want a phone with a good quality camera this is not for you, personally I dont care for cameras in phones I have a stand alone camera that will always produce better pictures than any phone camera I have seen so it is not an issue. One glaring omission though is lack of video support, another simple application that we need in our phones.. Bluetooth Connectivity. Rubbish best describes what is available on the iPhone and the iPhone 3G, you can connect to a headset or a car kit and that is your lot, where the heck is A2DP, this is a music phone after all and this should be standard, come on Apple, also why can I not connect to my laptop via bluetooth or with a cable and share the 3G internet connection, Windows Mobile has had this feature for years and how come I cannot do any file transfers either, it really is poor that these simple things are missing.. Messaging. Email is as near perfect on a phone as you can get with the iPhone in my opinion, no complaints at all, but SMS lacks the simple function of being able to forward a text message, or for that matter send a contact to someone else, all features seen in the most basic phones as standard. MMS, why is MMS still missing from the iPhone, again it is available on most cheap phones these days and whilst not a critical application it is handy to have when you need it, it should be there as standard.. Lack of Copy and Paste. This one for me is totally unforgivable, it totally cripples the iPhone and the potential of future Apps, whilst writing this an Application has been launched for Wordpress, it is a great App but unusable for me without copy and paste, could someone please explain why this is not a standard, unbelievable omission again.. Conclusion. The iPhone 3G is a fantastic phone, brilliant user interface, now with the added benefit of 3G speeds, third party applications and GPS but it is still the little things that are letting this phone down badly. Until Apple wake up and listen to what people want then this phone will remain a flawed genius. Potentially brilliant but when will we see the simple boxes ticked off to meet that potential, if we do then this phone is a real winner and will be a keeper for a long time, if it doesnt happen then Windows Mobile 7 could overtake the iPhone quite easily with the right user interface matched to its already superior feature list.. Positives. Multi Touch Interface and usability. 3G speeds. Music playback and storage. The App Store. Safari Browser. Email integration. Negatives. Battery Life. GPS functionality. Poor applications at launch. Too many missing simple functions. No copy and paste. No tethering.",49000,2014-05-30T18:01:29Z

The camera has a lot of features, and you must take time to get to know the camera if you want to take full advantage of how super it is. The battery life is great, I can shoot all day and still have some battery left to make it home to the charger. I really love the 10x zoom, you can capture some great shots, even from nosebleed seats at a concert. I recently attended the Madonna concert, and got some great shots in dark lighting with this camera. It also does well at the zoo, outdoor sporting events, etc. Indoors, it does seem to lack a bit, but if you take the time to properly set the camera for your shot, you will almost always get a great photo. I have really shaky hands, and the only time the image stabilizer lets up is when i'm zooming in real close, otherwise it works great.

The final event, when I drove in Italy (it was 38 degrees Celcius outside the car), was that the suction cup fell off the rest of the mount, so that the unit fell down on the dashboard!

Although the unit E- Trex can accurately navigate you along your route, you will need a magnifying glass to see it. I could not see the names of streets unless I zoomed in to maximum magnification. At that point the screen looses all context of where you are or where you are going i.e., the name of the steet fills the screen and you see little else.

Fortunatey we backed up everything every day - but while filming one day it announced a buffer error - then E:31:00 and that was that - Borneo, SIngapore, Christening all gone forever (except for the backup). The point is with a 120gb drive - you can lose a HUGE amount of footage in one go. We filled about half the drive in six months (all backed up) - but you dont know if the drive is faulty until you get to the bad sector or whatever it was. And then as soon as you get to the faulty bit - poof! If you phone Sony they just look up E errors in the manual and say it has to be returned.

2007,910,"I have never written a review on CNET, but I felt impelled to write one after my personal experience with this phone stands in sharp contrast to most of the reviews online. I had major reserves about purchasing this phone after reading about the abysmal battery life and SD card issues. Without going into too much detail, people in a similar position can rest assured that the battery life is more than adequate. I regularly get a full day of battery life and I like to think I use the phone moderately to heavily throughout the day. Additionally, it is compatible with micro USB chargers so you should find no issues charging it at the office or topping up in the car without spending an arm and a leg on the charging unit. That being said, I do recommend the igo car charger. In a 15 min drive I gained 20 percent on my battery, not bad in my book! I really cannot figure out why my experience with the battery life is so positive compared to the reviews, but I just felt it was important to provide another POV. Also, regarding the SD card issues, it seems the HTC firmware update solved the issue because I have not experienced any problems. I highly recommend this phone. The features are every bit as impressive as they sound on paper and I have spent over a week marveling at the refined quality of this phone.

I can take clear pictures in broad daylight which are visibly better than those from my compact Sony 7.1 MP camera. However, at lower light conditions (e.g. late afternoon, indoors etc.) which requires higher than 100 ISOs, the pictures are quite noisy. In fact I would recommend using ISO-100 and brighten up the picture with some software tool. The built in flash can also help but at close range and indoors. Me overall experience is mixed: I like it but I am not enthousiastic about it.

19605,442,"As I said before, this is a profesional camera, as any other complicated tool, you have to get used to it and learn its nuances (the 5D has many inlcuding picture styles and the C mode).. There are too many plusses to list, yes its considerably more expensive than a DRebel, but for what it offers compared to the 7000$ 1DsMKII its a bargain!. Also, IMHO this is not a camera that CNET should be reviewing. CNET is a consumer level website, and this is definatly not a consumer level camera (for price, and specific options). CNET should stick to the mini-digitals!.",75000,2011-05-11T17:17:01Z

3348,505,"The picture just blew us away right out of the box especially for us coming from 9 yr old Sony LCD. We thought the TV was easy to set up right out of the box. In less than 2 hours we had it hooked up through the receiver, had the Blu Ray player, and Wii all ready to go. The menu is very easy to use and the basic setting are easy to scroll through and change. Now that we have had it for a week I would like to get into really setting the TV up but this where we/I will need some help. The only minor thing I can think of is w/ the Wii and the PQ not being so great but I am sure there is a game mode somewhere to help that out. If you go direct to the TV the Wii PQ is fine but then no surround sound but if I go through the receiver the PQ becomes fuzzy. Other than that I cannot imagine finding a better TV out there right now unless you are just made of money and a complete AV expert.. I will post back after we have had it for a while to see how it does over w/ more use and better calibration.",77000,2014-06-20T07:16:55Z

9857,451,"This is a terrific camera. The quality is excellent. Very intuitive menu that is easily maneuvered with the joy stick on the viewfinder. The stabilizer is superb. I've never seen one so good, even on prosumer cameras. On-camera microphone good. I don't like where the inputs are or the little rubber tabs that close off the ports when not used - but it is a very small camera - so where are you going to put jacks? The battery cannot be changed out when the camera is mounted on a tripod - the battery release latch is under the tripod mount. That's a big bummer. The battery that ships with the camera will shoot for about an hour - with moderate use of the zoom - my moderate use was my son's YMCA basketball game. The video is incredibly clear - Edits fine in Adobe Premiere CS4 - dual core laptop running Vista. Plug camera into computer and it shows up just like an external hard drive (which it is). Files transfer via USB very quickly. I can see where in the sunshine it would be difficult to see the monitor - but that's not a deal breaker either - cannot see spending several hundred for the model up that has a viewfinder. Overall, very well pleased and would recommend it highly. Biggest beefs - but not deal breakers: short battery life on ship battery; battery release in wrong place for tripod mount; Little rubber port covers are aggravating when things are plugged in - the rubber tabs are sort of in the way; Incredible video camera with mic jack. Stabilizer simply amazing. Oh - one last thing - the still shot button is on top of the camera - how I find myself holding the camera - which is often at waste level, the still shot button on top of the camera should have been the 'record' button or be the record button when it's in the video mode and the still shot button when it's in still shot mode. (the record button is on the back of the camera and when the camera is gripped with fingers through the grip handle, record is a thumb button - activated with one's thumb. Not always is my camera at eye level which I shoot. Again, not a deal breaker - just not smart engineering - top button should have been an alternate record - just as the Canon XL-2 has one on top, one near the grip. I ordered my Camera from Amazon and saved about $400 from the local big box store. Got a heck of a deal. Very well pleased overall. If I had to make the decision all over, I'd go with this camera again..",81000,2012-04-12T14:59:25Z

18902,995,"Just took this camera with me on a Mediterranean cruise to Spain, France, and Italy and got some really nice shots with minimum hassle. The optical stabilization works great for photos and the scene settings seem to work well. I haven't played with the manual settings but they are there if I ever feel adventurous :) I was able to get sharp shots in good light at full optical zoom with no tripod. The 26x zoom makes all the difference when trying to get that small detail. It does a fairly decent job with the HD video as long as you don't expect to be able to use the full zoom range without a tripod.. Some photos (mostly low-light ones) look a bit grainy at 100% size, tho good at around 80% so if you consider this an 8MP camera, then it does an excellent job.. Overall, this is a solid camera. I really like the pics I'm able to get with the big zoom and I'm able to overlook the rare annoyance for this..",86000,2014-11-01T21:57:14Z

Most specifically, the reviewer states at one point, The iPod Shuffle's slim design and all-metal construction make the SanDisk Sansa Clip (left) look like a beast, but the iPod's elegance comes with some sacrifice.. Come now. Yep, the SanDisk Sansa Clip certainly is a beast, only slightly larger than last week's Shuffle and in a cute-appearing form factor, offering a small OLED screen providing all the info. you need, an FM radio, a recorder, an equalizer, a sleep timer, ogg vorbis and flac capability, multiple bookmark capability, 15-hour battery life, etc., etc., that in the end is a full-featured audio player shrunk down to matchbook size.. Oh, and currently on sale at U.S. Wal-Mart b&#38;m's at $49 for 8 gb's of storage--in other words, twice as much storage as the new Shuffle for just a bit over half the cost..

20699,793,"In the three weeks we've had Metro PCS, we have HATED them. Firstly, in the first week my husband had his phone, he could NOT call me (Im on a sprint network) - there was a problem with metropcs cell towers. WHen he needed to call me, he had to pull over to a payphone to call me. His employee, also on metropcs, could not call me on the sprint network. On the 8th day, however, they fixed the problem. Then my husband went to Washington DC and Annapolis and could not get a signal at all. Metropcs's response? Well, maybe he should try roaming, at an extra charge. I said but you're supposed to WORK in that area - their response oh well, too bad. Thirdly, all this time he has not been able to use call waiting. When he pressed the talk button, he cut everyone off - which is most frustrating and he lost customers because of this. He finally took the phone back and surprise surprise, they said it's faulty - so they are ordering a new one. He asked if he could upgrade to a better phone, and they said sure, but we will not give you ANY money back on this old phone - it's USED! He said but it's faulty - and after all the problems we've had, why can't you help me = I want to pay a lot more money and get a better phone but you MUST give me some credit for this phone - they refused. I spoke to Jose Fernandez in the store in Hialeah - a more useless cretin you could not find anywhere on this planet. I told him all these problems, and he said I'm so sorry, so I said that's nice, but what are you going to do about this? and he said Nothing. THEY COULD NOT CARE LESS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. They have a good monthly plan if you don't mind dropped calls and terrible reception and no signal when you leave Fort Lauderdale or MIami - but they are just awful. The worst customer service in the entire world - definitely the worst experience I have had. I remember the very next day after my husband first got this plan and the new phone - we were unhappy with the phone and we wanted to take it back - and my husband had used 1 hour and 12 minutes of talk time - AND THEY SAID NO WAY! YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS PHONE, you only have 59 minutes of talk time to use before it becomes a USED PHONE and we will not take it back. Seriously, I cannot use the language Id like to use to describe the services of Jose Fernandez and his boss, Richard, at the Hialeah store, more useless, non-caring, impartial, pathetic people you could not wish to meet. I rue the day we EVER switched to metro pcs and will be canceling at the endo f this month. AVOID AVOID AVOID. I have to say I love Sprint - but I wish they had a cheaper unlimited talk plan, then my husband would switch to that, but as it is, they are too expensive. You get what you pay for.

7590,397,"There is an UGLY surprise waiting for early TIVO Series 3 customers! When that $300 3-year contract that you added to your $800 DVR runs out: LOOK OUT! You are back at square one on TIVO service pricing.. You will then have to buy the same new service contract as a new customer. TIVO didn't have a machine-lifetime service package back when you bought your $800 TIVO DVR so you bought the 3-year, $300 service package. Now, with competition from free DVRs bundled into your cable service, TIVO sells a machine-lifetime service plan for $400, just $100 more than their old 3-year service plan.. But to purchase that machine-lifetime subscription for your three-year-old machine, you have to pay the same price as a new customer buying that TIVO service for his brand new machine. That means machine-lifetime service for your TIVO Series 3 will end up costing you $700 where the customer buying a brand new machine today is paying $400 for that same service. That old TIVO Series 3 you rushed out to buy, will end up costing you a total of $1,500 ($800 for the machine plus $700 for the TIVO service).. Meanwhile, the new customer is getting his new TIVO HD DVR for less than $300 and his service package for $400. His HD machine and service will cost him less than $700. Your machine and service will cost you more than twice as much. Thanks TIVO. Way to take care of your loyal early-adopters. Doesn't make you want to rush out and buy a new TIVO DVR does it?. Watch out for another major TIVO gotcha. That lifetime TIVO service product you might decide to buy cannot be rolled over to a new machine. When your current machine is no longer viable or you decide to go to satellite TV, you will forfeit your whole investment and be back at square one, buying a new machine and a new service plan..",94000,2013-06-29T19:09:18Z

I love the phone, but sometimes these design flaws and high maintenance really turns me off. I am constantly cleaning the screen so I can use it. I have changed my hand positioning when I make a call or hold the phone because of the power/lock button. The issue of not being a plug and play still haunts me. Zune syncs things into my phone that I don't want it too. Sometimes the integration of my facebook into my phone isn't what I want. I still don't like the fact that the micro sd card is internal and you HAVE to use a windows 7 approved card, which means it's going to be expensive. The apps are great to have and use. There are litterally thousands of free apps and pay for apps available. I wish people left more comments on the apps to see if it's worth downloading. The music and video app is great, but you can not use an mp3 in your data base to turn it into a personal ringtone. These are just some issues that I have encountered and I have had this phone for only a week. I hope that windows 7 people come out with a patch relativley soon to fix some to all of these issues.

10522,928,"CNET can ***** about fine points if they want but if i had $400 and could choose ANY game console this would be the one! It packs the MOST value in for the price out of all the next gen consoles including the Wii and every flavor of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.. The whole machine cost less than just adding upgrades to the lowest price Xbox 360. To upgrade the Xbox 360 Arcade to be like the 40 gb PlayStation 3 you would need a hard drive $99 - $189, Wi-Fi add on $99, HD-DVD drive $180, and online service $50 per year. Their is no contest - this is a better value.. Also CNET says that the bad is:. Compelling exclusive games are still few and far between; - I have personally downloaded nearly 50 of the weekly FREE game demos that come from the PlayStation Network. Also Ratchet &#38; Clank, Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, Heavenly Sword, WarHawk, MotorStorm and a ton of other games are available for the PlayStation 3. All the same games that are available for the Xbox 360 are available for the PlayStation 3 (except of course for exclusives such as Gears of War,BioShock, and Mass Effect).. doesn't play PS2 games; - Well for $100 more you can get the 80 gb version that has can play PS2 games and includes MotorStorm. Also for $129 you can buy a PS2 slim or you can buy a used one for much less ($50-$75) at a GameStop or EB Games.. PlayStation Home and rumble controller not available until 2008; - CNET really is just nit-picking and being hypocritical with this one. They do not mention that the Xbox 360 does not have motion sensing or a virtual player avatar yet as a CON for the system.. a USB port on the back would've been nice;. Well bluetooth on the Xbox 360 or a USB port on my behind would have been nice too but it aint there!. no infrared port means non-Bluetooth universal remotes aren't compatible; - Are you kidding??? How can you complain that you would rather have an infared remote supported rather than a bluetooth one! I found the bluetooth remote to be lighter and to have more range. It is like complaining that your DVD player does not support VHS tapes! Really petty CNET!. glossy black finish is a fingerprint magnet; - Well white finishes are a dirt and stain magnet. I guess they would rather look at dirt, scuffs, and stains than notice a fingerprint up close. Still petty CNET!. online gaming, media, and commerce options not nearly as developed as Xbox Live. -Considering the service just came out last year it is still on par with Xbox Live. In fact i am disappointed that MicroSoft is not doing more with the service considering the enormous head multi-year start Xbox Live had AND that they charge each gold member $50 per year. With all that time and money they have the consumer should have received more or it should be FREE by now.. Despite CNET's petty nit-picking i say that the 40 gb PlayStation 3 is by far and away the BEST value for the money that you are going to see in next generation gaming. All that and it comes with a FREE copy of the High Definition version of the Spider-Man 3 Movie - worth $35 on it own..",107000,2009-05-05T02:57:43Z

Well, when I connect either one of the Maxtor 1TB Extreme drives to my PC via Firewire 400 (either as the last node in a daisy chained series of drive or directly to my PC), it would not communicate.

Bottom line -- This product is to be avoided, especially at its current price.. One question I have - how did the Cnet staff test this drive?

The supplied windshield mount is cumbersome and illegal here in California. It would block my view in any case. No console mount came with the device. It is extremely slow to start up; the manual says it may take 20 minutes the first time and that if it gets a fix in the first 5 minutes to continue sitting still for 15 more minutes. Right. Unlike my Garmin GPS, I can't see how to easily transfer addresses and files to the Navigon. The device gives excessive and useless information. Continue on US 101 Stay on US 101 Keep left on US 101. We had about a half dozen of these in 5 minutes on a section of freeway with no real complexity. Traffic warnings, when they pop up, are next to impossible to read while driving and to get the navigation screen back you have to interact with the thing. That's always a problem while move, but especially when it is telling you that traffic is a problem directly ahead. Selection of which POIs to show was not logical. This thing makes me feel pretty stupid and I am an engineer, an MBA and a credentialed teacher! Not recommended..",111000,2009-06-11T19:01:47Z
20228,838,I paid 280.00 for the camera and had no complain at all. A lot of features and the Macro were great. I tested Macro function on a postcard portrait and every one seen the picture thought it was taken from a live model. The size was so compact that I could just carry the camera in my pocket all day long without even thought about it. I rated a 9 due to only 3X optical zoom. If it has a 4X or 5X optical zoom then it would be a perfect 10. Definitely recommended for any one wanted a compact camera for great picture..,112000,2008-05-31T07:38:09Z

3644,761,"Overall the best phone on the market by any carrier. The iPhone can take a hike with it's proprietary garbage. This phone comes pre-loaded with great software. Avatar, mobitv, and the soon to be live Meida Hub.. The newest Android phone is also the best. No rooting necessary as this beast carries a 1GHz Hummingbird processor capable of handling anything that you throw at it, including the bloat ware, and does it with out so much as a hiccup.. It is durable and built to withstand every day use. Durability tests have proven that a screen protector is not really necessary. The Gorilla glass holds up against anything. From my personal use I have been very careful but no matter what, fingerprints happen. One wipe and it is like it was just out of the box. People complain that it feels cheap and my response to that is that it held up perfectly from drops of 90CM. Just because it is thin and doesn't feel strong doesn't mean that it isn't.. I have been enjoying Kindle. The screen is so big and bright that reading books is a breeze. Seriously, I am carrying around about 15 books in my pocket everywhere I go. The screen, yes, a AMOLED screen which makes people druel when they see Avatar playing.. Overall the best Phone I have owned to date. Running 2.1 Update 1 with rumors of 2.2 being released on September. And yes, it does have GPS issues but the 2.2 is supposed to take care of it. If they don't send out 2.2 in September, they are at least promising a GPS fix in September.. I would recommend this phone to anyone in a heartbeat.

15313,352,"While I thought that John Falcone's review is mostly accurate and I agree that the Series3 is a very good product, some business decisions that Tivo made, make the Series3 a flawed product.. Inputs:. The Series3 has Antenna and Cable inputs. However the Cable input is RF only. TiVo could have include an HDMI input for recording from some HDMI compatible source such as DirecTV. People tell me that the DirecTV signal is not compatible with the Series3. If a signal can go from a DirecTV reciever to my TV then it can be recorded by the Series3 with the addition of some hardware and software to the package.. Networking:. I sent the following to TiVo with regards to another busines decision that the made. &lt;&lt;I understand your concerns about copyright infringement. However, the new TiVo Series3 box is a computer. On my computer, I can designate some files as sharable over a network and other files as private. Why can't you?. The TiVo Series3 box should:. 1. Be able to access and show any file recorded on a Series2 machine (multi-room viewing). 2. Any file recorded on a Series3 box via the OTA (over the air) or Antenna source should be mark sharable and available for viewing by other Series2 (standard definition oly) or Series3 (both SD and HD fornats) boxes.. 3. Any file from the cable source can be flagged as private and not sharable.. This can be accomplished easily through your programming. Add a routine to the recording process that checks to see if the source is cable and then flag that file as Private. All other files should be flagged as Sharable. Then add to the code used by the Series2 boxes to check for Private vs Sharable files and add this code to the Series3.. Will Mullen. TiVoing since 2002&gt;&gt;. The two business decisions that TiVo has made with regard to the Series3 means that in one instance, they are deliberatly writing off all their DirecTV customers, forcing those costomers to switch to cable or live without premium channels. In the other instance, TiVo removes from its feature list the ability of its customers that own multiple boxes, the ability to reocord in one location in the home and to view that recording in another. Neither business decision is sound and as a result I must rate the Series3 box at a lower level than Mr. Falcone..",121000,2009-05-27T17:07:26Z
625,807,"Bought this at the end of August when I finally found a great deal on it ($1600). Got it home hooked it up, easy start up menu watched a couple movies, loved it. Then after 2-3 weeks my HDMI ports 1 and 2 stopped working what was plugged into them and started playing the movies that where hooked to HDMI 3 (my dvd port). So HDMI 1, 2, and 3 showed the same thing. But the Xbox and Cable box wouldn't show anything on 1 or 2. 3 and 4 worked normal just 1 and 2 screwed up. Called to have someone sent out, they told me in a couple days and gave me a 6 hour window to wait! Then the guy never shows! called back, said they would come out the next day, guy says around noon, 1pm he calls says running behind around 3pm instead, around 5 he calls says around the corner, 10 minutes... Never shows again! He finally comes out a week later, enters some code, resets TV and it works again. Says it's something in the TV set and all it needed was a factory reset to get it working. Moving to Florida so TV gets packed away for 2 weeks till we move and get cable, cable guy comes out to hook everything up and oh what do you know..more problems! I hooked the cable to the HDMI port but he decided to try the analog so the Picture in Picture would work, cannot get a signal thru the Analog cable hookup. Hooked cable wire up the cable box, plugged in the HDMI, perfect. Carried TV to another room just in case, tried in another room, same problem. Have to call Samsung still about this problem, be interesting to see what they say or do this time.. Outside of the input problems, I love the set. The kids can figure out how to use it, the picture looks great, Blu-ray looks great on it and even the speakers aren't half bad. Hopefully they can take care of these problems cause I would really like to enjoy the TV without the frustrations..",122000,2009-12-14T14:19:26Z
14937,709,"I wanted a camera that could take some abuse of my family vacations and it has held up really well from the dessert to the snow and Disney World in between. I purchased it with the extened battery and charger as well as two 8GB and one 16GB flash. This combination has been great. Along with the built in 16GB of flash I have never run into power or storage problems. Have used it from 7 am early entrance at Disney Hollywodd Studios to the midnight Fantasmic show. I used it as much as I wanted and never came close to having a problem. It is smart enough to know when it has been left on and will shut down by itself. I would also recommend purchasing a good video editng suite like vegas or pinnacle that can handle the AVCHD format. Nero 8 and higher does it as well for simple edits. The video quality is great. It looks fine in bright lite and pretty good in low light. It does not have night vision but that is okay I am not a stalker. Surprisngly the stll camera shots look outstanding even though they are only at ~3.2 megapixels. I have a highly rated 9MP sony point and shoot and they are comparible in quality of picture. The Cannon has much less visual noise but the pictures of course arenot as big, I will say stabiliy is difficult to acheive successfully whe hokding in hand as it is small. For a steadier shot I would use a tri or mono pod. I was bale to get some beautiful Belagio fountain videos in Vegas. I would have to say that this camera is my wifes favorite gadget I have ever purchased it and it is simple enough for her to use. She prefers it over our still camera for family events and holidays. I could not recomend this camera more. There may be a few quarky things that people don't like but if you have a lot of gadgets you get used to it and it doesn't bother you.

12878,529,"I bought my PS3 in April 2007, as I decided to wait out the initial hype after owning a PS2 and having a 360 I play constantly. Since April I doubt I have 5 hrs of use with the PS3 besides all the time I have used it for to watch Blu-Ray's on. After comparing the hardware in the PS3 and the 360 (they really aren't dramatically different) individuals are MUCH better off buying a 360. Game selection is the main reason us gamers purchase systems, and there is only one sole Sony specific game I am waiting (and have been since the PS3 went on sale) on to come out, and that is the continuation of the SOCOM series. It has by far been Sony's bread winner as far as game sales, and online player participation. With SOCOM on the PS2 I can sadly say I spent over 2,000 hours..yes 2,000 hrs playing those games. Here it is just shy of a year later and Sony doesn't even have a scheduled release date for the continuation of the SOCOM series for the PS3. Yes they are making a new one for the PSP, but not for their $$ maker. Additionally when Sony does bring to the table a game that has tens of thousands of players online at a time, like they did with SOCOM 1,2,3 they need to take as many pointers from MicroSoft as possible on making a seamless online playing experience. You get what you pay for and with Sony's online being free, you'll see what I mean. As of now, on the few occasions when I have tried to play WarHawk on my PS3 I have had nothing but problems connecting to games and when I do connect, chatting with other's is next to impossible, but I have NEVER had one single issue with any 360 MultiPlayer game.. Sony has alot to learn and hopefully with this latest price drop and the manufacturing of smaller machines (hardrive capacity wise) there will be more people purchasing and in turn maybe light a motivational fire under Sony's butt and have them and their developers focus on pumping out some real games..",126000,2012-06-04T19:11:05Z

All the hardware buttons are nicely laid out and the USB sliding ?door? is a very elegant solution. Pull this phone out and people notice it right away. It is a daily charger when it comes to battery and does not quite make it through a full day of intense use. Love that Snapdragon processor!. Using the phone.. First thing I found out is that Windows Phone 7 (WP7) is a two-handed operation. There is very limited ability for any one handed operation as the hardware back button is located on the very lower left of the unit and is heavily used through the WP7 experience. As a Blackberry user I never appreciated so much the ability to pull out the unit, check email and return the unit one handedly until I used the WP7.. There is no haptic choice for feedback while typing only sound. The sound is so quiet you turn up the sounds which turns up your ringer. You put in your headphones and reduce the volume the ringer/notification volume reduces this includes alarm notifications. Yep, there is one master volume in WP7 and it really sucks. As far as notification goes you can choose sound and vibration, sound, vibration or none. You cannot tailor the vibration notifications at all and the sound notification choices are very limited. Nor can you adjust the LEDs for notifications. One can also not change the ringtones or add ringtones. Yes you read that correctly, the dozen ringtones you get with the unit are the ones you are stuck with and cannot be modified. (From the Windows Phone support page- Note It?s not currently possible to add ringtones to your Windows Phone 7.). The unit has no bedside or auto on/off modes.. Themes should have been called colors as that is all you can adjust colors and whether the background is light or dark.. You have a ?unified? calendar but no unified mailbox.

I?ve lodged a bug complaint on the email and the calendar as changes made to email are not being reflected on the servers (marked as read, deleted, moved to a folder). This occurs on all my email accounts (Hotmail, Gmail, GP). Also calendar entries created on the phone do not make it to the Google calendar and this is a confirmed bug.

Known BUG. Power cycle is the only solution at this time.. -No Remote Desktop capability (this was native in WinMo 6.5.3 and is a huge oversite not being on WP7).

It can?t find places &#38; addresses 70% of the time.. -If you use the GPS to drive around and don?t have your phone plugged in? it will be dead in ~1.5 hours.. -Exchange Notes are MIA. -The device can have multiple calendars but it will only sync one calendar!. -The device only vibrates two times on inbound calls.

11137,910,"My review, or blog, is about a Panasonic G10 Plasma but it starts with a Vizio. I purchased my 50 inch Vizio VP505XVT after reading a lot of outstanding reviews from every respectable HDTV critic (CNET, HDGuru, PCMag, UltimateAVMag.com). One of my favorite review quotes comes from CNet, ?Simply put, the Vizio VP505XVT is one of the better-performing plasma TVs we've tested this year from any manufacturer?. That said it all, I was sold, and I?m getting a 505XVT. The set retailed for $1599.99 at the time but Costco was selling it for $1199.99. I ran over to my local Costco at Pentagon City in Arlington VA and purchased it. For the next 85 days I loved the set. My one complaint was the Image Retention(IR), I followed the 100 hour break-in rule but found that even after the 100 hours, I still had constant IR. Nothing permanent, the IR would typically fade after 20 minutes to an hour of full screen programming. But it was a chore, constantly having to combat the IR and always trying to prevent it. I wanted a plasma though, LCD shortcoming were not acceptable to me.. I decided to replace my Visio with a brand new 2009 G10, I figured I would lose nothing. Costco has a no questions asked 90 day return policy, so I exercised it. Vizio?s Flagship, top-of-the-line plasma should be equal to Panny?s middle-of-the-road plasma, right? And for the most part they are similar. Black levels, to my eye, are no different, both produce incredibly inky blacks but small things existed on the Visio that didn?t on the Panny. What might those be you ask? 1080p-over-component. To my dismay, I plugged up my X-Box 360 to my new G10 and no picture. After fumbling around with the component cables, I learned of the G10?s shortcoming. I remembered setting my X-Box to 1080p as a test on the Vizio and it worked to my surprise. I assumed 1080p-over-component was only a feature on the most high end HDTV so I was quite happy to find it available on my Vizio Plasma for $1199.99. I purchased the G10 for $1499.99 but at the time its MSRP was $1999.99. Surely a TV as expensive at that would include a feature found on a cheaper, budget brand television. Nope, I learned that Vizio and Samsung include 1080p-over-component on all there 1080p sets now. I guess I am just stuck with 1080i for my X-Box.. My other gripe with the Panasonic G10 is it?s ability to scale an interlaced image to the native progressive display. For most channels I receive over my DirecTV satellite service it works okay, but a few channels, namely Discovery HD Theater, the very top of the screen is not filled with the picture. Kind of like a 2cm letterbox, but it doesn?t exist on the bottom of the picture, only the top. I know for a fact the Vizio didn?t do this. I used Discovery HD Theater for my plasma breaking period, because of the channels lack of a permanent channel logo and the 100% full screen HD programming. To combat this issue I used the overscan picture setting while breaking in my G10 but this was a nuisance to me. Why doesn?t it scale correctly, and why does TNTHD scale perfectly. I know the Vizio VP505XVT has a higher end video processor than the Panny. The benefit is: better scaling and de-interlacing of all non-1080p content. The SD picture quality of the 505XVT was noticeably better than on the G10.. My last complaint for the G10 is the menu and remote. There is no quick way to change picture presets. I use a brighter picture present (Custom) for daytime viewing and sporting events and THX mode for nighttime viewing and movies. This switch requires me to go multiple clicks into the menu, while the Visio had a dedicated button. Also no Universal Remote for the Panny, it only controls the TV (unless you have special Panasonic brand accessories and use VieraLink). This is easily looked past if you have a Logitech Harmony Remote, which it do, but the omission puzzles me.. Now this is not a blog to trump the Panasonic G10. I do enjoy the HD picture. I have DirecTV so I watch 95% HD content. The G10 design so pretty. I love the Television but if I can do it again, I wouldn?t have traded returned my Vizio. To me, the 505XVT performs equal to the high standards set by the G10, and even surpasses it in features (HQV video processing, 1080p-over-component, SRS Surround Sound w/ DTS decoding, Better menu and immensely more robust picture control). The only thing I find the Panasonic offers that the Visio doesn?t is: Better Anti-Image Retention and VieraCast Internet Services. Sure THX mode is there but it isn?t all that it is cracked up to be. The casual TV watcher would probably prefer a non-THX preset due to the Dim contrast presented in THX mode. Most people would be 100% happy with the beautiful Panasonic G10, as I mostly am, but believe it is a slight downgrade from the Vizio VP505XVT. Now if I never purchased the Vizio first, I would give the G10 five stars. It just sucks when you pay more money and lose features.. Updated. on May 10, 2009.",140000,2013-12-14T00:27:41Z

13772,356,"This is one of those phones where if you're just going off specs and trying to compare it to the higher end Androids, and you decide not to buy it, you're sorely missing out. The photos, videos and specs of this phone simply do not do it justice until you see it up close and personal for yourself.. The first thing I noticed out of the box is it's rather compact size and pocketability. In my opinion it's the perfect size, not too thin or thick, extremely comfortable in the hand and has a very sturdy build. It felt much better to hold on to than the HTC incredible, which I couldn't really get a nice grip on (too thin for my taste). In terms of the hardware, the hard plastic with the chrome accents make it look very elegant, and the quality of the tactile keyboard is excellent, extremely comfortable to type on due it its spaced out keys.. Two things I worried about after reading some reviews were the processor speed and the screen resolution. I felt because it didn't have a 400X800 touch screen or a 1gig snapdragon processor I would have an outdated, sluggish and visually unappealing phone. Again, don't let the specs fool you. Multitasking on this phone is great, I've experienced no lag, menus glide in an out very smoothly. The screen is excellent too. I've read that it wasn't as sharp or vivid as higher end phones, but I've found the screen to be pretty sharp and vivid, even for it's lower resolution.. This is a great phone for novice users but offers a lot to more experienced smartphone users, and it's keyboard and features will leave a lasting impact in the ever growing family of Android phones..",142000,2011-06-25T10:06:16Z

Easy to play with HDMI CEC which works admirably by inserting a disc, the TV turns on and change the source to Blu-Ray input and starts playing. Clean and simple menu and setup screen to change.

Loaded some Blue Planet, Planet Earth, other documentaries, Cars, Black Hawk Down, Hellboy, Underworld, 300, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, all of which loaded faster than I anticipated and played admirably..

I love sharing my calendar with my secretary and my spouse. My spouse has an Android phone, so she shares her calendar with me, and we have no more excuses for messing up each other's schedule. People looking at the phone especially love the camera and the quality of the pictures. With the single cord used for recharging, you can recharge through a USB slot, and even open the SD card from the computer to upload or download files or pictures. The bad old days of having to pay extra for all these features once offered separately are now gone with one great device that can do nearly everything in one package, at one price (unless you want to buy some Andrid apps).

17805,830,"Ok. This is a great phone. Actually it's a non-windows PPC with phone capabilities. The music player started up the first time and there was no waiting to scan the SD card. Unlike the Instinct. I love the qwerty slider although the space bar on th bottom row of keys does take a bit of getting used to, but there is actually a row dedicated to numbers, unlike the T-mobile MDA (aka HTC Wizard). The sound is loud, actually ear-splitting if the volume is at max and you hold it near your ear. Camera is 3.2 mega pixel, but threre is no provision to zoom in. Not really a problem for me as I don't use the camera all that often. The things I do use it for, it excels at. The internet is actually usable, unlike the Instint (Instink, I call it). You can sync your google calander and contacts to the phone and when the sync settings are set properly. It will actually push the contacts and apointments to your phone as you add them. One problem I noticed was that when I try to send a contact via bluetooth to the Moment, it says Content Received but the contact is not listed in contacts. The battery life is not the greatest, but the best solution to that is to download the TaskKiller app. That does help. But surfing the net does take a fair amount of juice. As does playing music through the speaker. It's better when you use headphones. Sound wise and on the battery. I do have a quibble with Sprint. This is *NOT* the phone's fault. Currently you are unable to upgrade the firmware over the air. You have to take the device to a repair center and they will perform the flash for you. According to Sprint, over the air updates will be here soon. Hope they follow through with that as the device ships wih Android 1.5 Cupcake.

I bought an LG for about the same price today (sorry, I forget the model). Honest, I don't work for them or have anything to gain from promoting them. But their machine is MILES ahead of the 360, no contest whatsoever! The several movies I've tried (startup only) have been in progress within about 1/3 to 1/4 of the time the Sony takes!!

2907,789,"I bought two of these (one 8gb for my sister and one 16gb for myself...I was being greedy). The player works well and I think the Cnet review is pretty on point for the most part. The player is crammed full of features, it sounds good and is chock full of features that should be standard on all players.. I wish that it came with bluetooth support, but I realize that this is still a fairly high class feature, so I won't hold it against the Zen for now.. As for working with the player, My sister is not zactly techie, but she loves the player. She does rely on me to upgrade her firmware, but then I do all her electronic things for her.... I think the player is nice, but the real reason I chose it was the SD card. Since i use SD card in my digital cameras i wanted to be able to 'dump' my memory onto something while I am in the field (of saaaay Cambodia) and be able to keep shooting. The Zen has can do this and has allowed me to keep my overactive photophinger going. One caveat: The firmware only allows for you to copy over the ENTIRE SD card. which is cool if you are trying to do a mass dump quickly, but does not allow to take a single or small group of pictures for safe keeping. I hope they change this in the future as this can fill up the player quickly.. A common gripe against the SD card is that it is not supported as a part of the memory. This IS annoying, but it isn't horrid. You have to think of the SD card as a separate drive, not as a part of a player. Going to the SD card will stop your music and you can't search or browse the same way. I find that if I keep video on there, it isn't quite as jarring, and keeps my player space open for music.. Also, realize that while the Zen does play video well, I have yet to find something that will play natively. The conversion process through Windows Media isn't bad, but there are times I wish I could just stick my SD card in and watch with out planning for it. Still the video player came in handy more than once while waiting for whatever.. In all, I like the player and would recommend it..",166000,2012-10-06T13:42:15Z

11931,887,"I've been doing research on HDTVs for about a year now. I've read several reviews (from CNET and others) and watch the HDTV buyers guide video DL.TV put out several months ago. I felt I was a bit informed, but I just wasn't ready to spend $2000 on a new system.. I recently returned from an assignment in South Korea and noticed that the furniture movers would not ship Plasma TVs due to their fragile components. That got me thinking. I wanted to buy an HDTV in the near future and since I move around a lot, I better look into alternatives.. Last December my wife and I purchased a digital projector with DLP technology and we totally love it! The problem is the hassel of setting up, taking down, and the fan at times can be noisy. We knew we'd eventually get an HDTV, but my wife wanted a brand name and I wanted to first upgrade one of our computers and turn it into the Family entertainment center.. Last week, while in Costco shopping for some supplies, my wife and I saw this television and the price. $699.99 plus tax for a 32 LCD HDTV was a great bargin. What really cought our eyes were the PC input and HDMI tuner features. (Try to find a brand name set with the same specs and I'm sure you'll spend at least $300.00 or more for the system.). It's a great entry level set and we haven't been disappointed. We use it for video games, movies, computer use, and television viewing. Some minor adjustments were made to get a better view of the computer screen and movies, but the instructions were easy to read and the onboard menu was simple to navigate. The only thing I'm having a hard time adjusting with is the layout of the remote, but with time I'll get the hang of it.. The only thing I wish the package included was a swival stand. It does come with a stand, but our set is on a desktop and if we had a swival stand, we would be able to move the set to angle appropriate for the number of viewers in the room. Overall, we're very please with the system and don't regret our purchase!. Once last thing to remember: Get digital or HD service if you want to use any HDTV. Without the proper signal, the TV programs will not look very good on any HDTV.. Overall, my family and I are happy with the purchase..",169000,2011-10-20T03:30:16Z

TomTom has focused on being able to store pictures and play music while it has forgotten the basics for a GOOD GPS System. The 910 with the battery that takes forever to charge and runs out much earlier that the specification states, does not have the basics like ignition sensing. That means that every time you switch off your car the power is being chewed up unless you remember to reach over and push the power button off every time. It has also shown itself to have many software bugs. This is most likely because the TomTom team was too exited that they could play MP3's while looking at their holiday snaps, and forgot that these units need to be robust and reliable. My POI warnings and phone ring tone no longer work ever since I played the TomTom sample MP3's.

20310,441,"This is an absolutely outstanding phone for media. The screen is large, bright, and high-resolution, making it a joy to watch web videos or movies. The rear-mounted speaker is loud enough for showing videos to friends, but the fact that it is rear-mounted means that the sound is muffled if you set the phone down. The screen is also large enough and bright enough to be suitable as an e-book reader--I read Kindle books on mine relatively comfortably. The web browser is fast and multi-touch pinch and zoom is a welcome upgrade from my previous, Android 1.6 phone. I haven't tried the TV output. Games, such as the included Sims 3, perform excellently with high frame-rate 3D graphics.. The large screen and light weight makes the phone rest somewhat awkwardly in the hands, and you might find it slipping out of your fingers if you don't invest in a gel case with some grip. The phone also gets hot--that's the powerful processor and GPU running, and draining battery fast.. The camera is a pleasant surprise. Photos are crisp and low-light shooting could be a lot worse. Video recording quality is absolutely top-drawer, with smooth HD at 720p.. In addition to the many excellent features supplied by Android itself, the Vibrant also has Samsung's useful UI additions. I particularly like being able to keep my work email and GMail separate, but have calendar events from both services merged into a single unified calendar.. The inclusion of excellent touchscreen keyboard alternatives such as Swype mitigates the lack of a physical keyboard a bit. Given the light weight and large size of the phone, a slide-out keyboard as on the MyTouch Slide would have been an excellent addition that would not add too much weight or bulk for my tastes. However, the physical controls I miss the most are the menu, home, search, and back keys. On the Vibrant they are touch-sensitive areas which are all but invisible when they are not backlit, forcing me to remember where they are with no haptic feedback until I've already pressed one of them. A touchpad, as on the MyTouch Slide, or a trackball, as on the MyTouch 3G, is also missing.. The GPS appears to be slow, and other applications appear to slow down when it is running. The compass appears to work very poorly, taking a long time to reorient itself when the phone moves. You'll notice that especially in Google Sky Map, which is much less useful on the Vibrant than on either of the MyTouch phones.. Call quality is excellent and reception is good.. The cons I've listed don't really change the fact that this is the most powerful Android phone on T-Mobile and has one of the best screens I've ever seen on a phone. Coupled with a surprisingly good camera and the excellent Android operating system, the screen makes this phone the best choice for T-Mobile customers looking for a phone with serious multi-media and/or gaming capabilities..",178000,2012-05-19T05:57:50Z

Wish you could reverse route but you need to input your destination every time - unless I am missing where this can be done. What about satalite maps as a map choice? I seen more expensive ones carry that but should be included in the core reqirements of a GPS. Live traffic option would be nice also. But that is an option. This is a low end, get you to where you need to go GPS and does that well. Just missing a couple things I would of liked to see in this price range..",184000,2012-02-25T00:56:07Z

I seriously did not see the value in owning another MP3 player, after owning multiple models and makes I just didn't see shelling out that much money for an over hyped product, I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG. Even when the G5 came out I thought the same thing as before...Why? That was until I received one for my birthday 3 days ago. I was floored when started to play around. Yes it is my first iPod and I'm sure anyone who owns a G4 might not see the value in buying another iPod I would agree. Sounds is rich and clear, even with the standard ear buds, but if you really want to experience it try using the Bose noise canceling headsets, youre in for a treat. Slimmer and lighter than previous models. Now the bad news:. Yes the back is chromed and shows the slightest smudge and scratches so dont even think about not getting a real case for it. Look for the hard case with the clear face and the opening for the click wheel made by Contour. Other cases will cut off the screen and are useless.. Even though it's the video iPod don't expect to start putting your movies and video on it right away, you're going to first need Quick Time Pro and convert and compress them to .mov. Apple wants to make it as hard as possible for you to start ripping your massive DVD collection and putting it on their product. I'm sure their worried about piracy as annoyingly noted on the plastic cover Don't Steal Music. Battery life could be an issue while playing video however in my book it is not a concern considering my portable dvd players battery only last for about the same amount of time so this isnt an issue for me, just make sure you buy your power adapter.. All in all I am very satisfied and am planning to have a very long relationship with iPod and apple..",185000,2010-04-18T16:40:38Z
14938,992,"I shall never, ever, i repeat, ever purchase another sony product for the remainded of my life. Besides further aggrevating me with runaournd brainles emails form tech support, Sony knows they screwed up releasing this camera. It's obviouse by looking at the newest models that quickly replace this family. But hey, let's hit the bad points.... 1. HORRIBLE INDOORS - My 1996 RCA VHS-C Does 100X Better and I bought it for 200 bucks, not 800.. 2. Does not capture fast action without pixel-jizzle. (Cant really explain the term, but blurry blocks while in fast motion.. 3. Screwy software, no suprise, and screwy audio/video codec that does not work with hardly any app except the pixela, which what in the world does this program REALLY DO besides convert the screwy format to MPEG-2 with even worse quality?. 4. 20mins in high qaulity, false advertisment on the 60 min. DVD-RWs, they are double-sided for god sakes! You have to flip them over to use the other 30min. GIVE ME A BREAK!!!. 5. Blantanly lies about Superior Video Qaulity stated in the advertisments. like mentioned earlier my 1995 cam has better color reproduction anywhere anyplace and antyime.. 6. Sony basically told me to go sit on a pole because their products are Perfect.. Oh yeah one good thing is that it takes barely acceptable video outdoors in noon sunlight.. This camera is WAY to leaning on the infrared light sources even after disabling all infrared features, color reproduction is horible, example pinks are peach, purples are grey, sony should be sued for ripping off america.. Bottom line.. BAD SONY!!! BAD... Go to you room. I'm willing to trade for the panasonic dvd that is 200 bucks cheaper than my sony. Or even one of the older sony digi 8s, back when sony made a good product. I hate my camera, and i'm stuck with it. This camera sucks so bad, even the dealers on ebay have difficulty finding suckers..

7726,803,"I have a tendency to buy tough, durable phones. My review might be a bit biased in that regard, but I hope that I'll provide information that should be useful for anyone who is considering this phone.. This phone has a mountain of potential and with the right applications and smart planning you can do much with it. The LG enV Touch has a large keyboard, two display screens that are gigantic for a phone of its size, and excellent reception. The external display is amazingly beautiful, and it can display can support 1.6 million colors. And that is absolutely insane, if you stop to think about it.. You can impress your friends by customizing the display with the wallpaper of your choice, which isn't possible with the iPhone. It may not possible to load this thing with the hundreds of applications that are available for the iPhone, but I personally think that the smaller number of applications that are available for this phone are superior.. Speaking of which, the document viewer for this phone is pretty good. I think that it's more convenient to use when it comes to reading documents from work than anything you'll find on the iPhone. It is fast and it has a sharp resolution.. For that matter, the texting capabilities on this phone are pretty good. I'm able to log-in to just about anything that I would with a normal computer, and I can use the version of Internet Explorer that's included on this phone to do anything that I could with a smartphone or a normal computer. In that regard, it actually seems to be a lot faster than my friend's Blackberry Storm. I know that the YouTube videos are definately a lot faster.. Really, the only thing that's wrong with this phone is that the screen has a tendency to scratch and the battery life is absolutely horrible. It's understandable why the battery life is so bad, but it's still rather annoying to deal with..",192000,2010-11-26T19:47:21Z

5529,355,"I bought this TV in late October 2009 and in the last few months I have experienced 3 significant failures. On the first failure they replaced the input board with another malfunctioning board. When I tried to explain the problem they did everything they could to side step the failure. You see the first failure was in the HDMI inputs and when the new board was installed the network port was bad but they tried to insinuate it was my network and not their board. They fought with me on the phone before I finally proved to them it was their equipment. They would not let their approved service technician troubleshoot it in their shop and made them deliver it back to my home and have me call tech support where they were very rude and lacked network knowledge. Over one month later I am still waiting for the input board which is still on back order with no projected date when it will be available. It then raises two questions, does this mean there are so many failures they can not keep up with the demand or is the supply support that poor they can't repair TV's less than one year old? Or are they so vindictive they decided to withhold repairs because they induced another problem into the TV and they do not care about the consumer's inconvenience? Based on my experience with the technical support to date I have received little confidence they have a compassion to consumers once they have your money for the product. Right now we have a TV that will not power up and have been without TV for a month with no relief in site. I have requested they replace the unit and even offered to pay the difference and purchase a larger TV. At this point I would not recommend buying any products from Panasonic as this experience has left me with a bad taste about their ability to stand behind their product warranty.

16986,679,"From a local store, I got this device naively yesterday. It was on sale. This was the first GPS we bought and my wife, my son and I were quite happy about it. It worked great until we drove back home. The only thing I noticed at that time was the touch screen was kind of slow and that I could type much faster than the machine response. But it was a small problem and I didn't care. Then, while we took a lunch I connected to a PC to update the software, thinking that it would be over by the time we finished our lunch. While we took lunch we promised to go shopping using our new device. After lunch I realized that the update was still progressing with progress bar at about 2/3 of the full length. So I told my wife the update is not done yet and we waited for another hour. I kept net-surfing so that the machine does not go to sleep. Well over an hour later, I still found the progress bar was at about 2/3! I coundn't see anything in the tomtom home window which I could tell the update was going normally. I started think that the update was frozen somehow. Then it came to my attention that there was a big red abort button which sounded like I could cancel the update. I hesitated a bit, but decided to click it and go shopping anyway as we planned. I thought I could do the update anyway in the evening if it takes a long time.... I quickly I realized that the device no longer contained the original map, making the device totally useless. I tried to update the software again, but this time I only got another error. So our plan changed to go back to the store to get another device. We could get a new one, and with that we went shopping as planned. Returning home, I connected my replaced device to my pc prepared to do a long update then the software said something like 'the serial # of your device is different from the last one. are you sure you want to change to the new one? you can change your device only every 6 months.' I of course clicked yes. Then the software gave me an error which I do not remember what it was. I restarted the software and connected the GPS to pc again, then what the software had to say was, 'your device serial # is different from what is registered. You can change it only 6 months later'. What? What kind of software is this? I bought this GPS today and I can do the update only 6 months later? No way. I called tomtom support. I got 'call us back on Monday to Friday'. This was Sunday. By this time I had developed enough sense that this update software was a piece of junk and that I would be wasting this hours after hours trying to fix the problem. I chose the quickest solution: return the device.. After browsing through internet posts I have now learned enough that my decision to return the device was right. There is a USB cable in the box as if they recommend an update. Tomtom should at least warn what kind of danger there exists in updating the software and how lot it is expected to take. The update software does not have a consumer grade quality.. I have now ordered a Garmin.. Updated. on Aug 25, 2010.",197000,2013-03-16T13:55:40Z
16383,329,"We upgraded from a Sony Wega 32 flat screen and have been very impressed with the performance of the Panasonic aside from a few niggles. Blacks are fantastic and the dynamic range is excellent. 1080 BDs look superb.. The TV isn't perfect however, hence the four star rating.. First, the reddish cast as referenced in the CNET review is quite noticeable on certain white and neutral tones. It's not a deal breaker although I'm surprised at how many scenes are affected. Images with lots of white or even light grey, such as clouds or overcast skies, are rendered with a light, blotchy pink cast. Skin tones however seem OK. Also, different video sources seem to exhibit varying levels of ruddiness so your mileage may vary depending on the content you are viewing.. Notwithstanding the red cast, the THX mode is fantastic, with excellent color reproduction straight out of the box. I use a NEC 2690 reference grade monitor for my photography business and am amazed at how close the Panasonic colors resemble those on the monitor. This makes it a great TV for viewing slide shows with accurate and predictable color.. Second, I would have preferred a backlit remote. In a dark room it is easy to switch channels instead of volume as the two rocker switches are identical in feel and are located side by side. The menus however are intuitive and it only took about 30 minutes to configure the unit.. Third, the speakers seem to lack mid range punch, especially with 5.1 sources. We haven't purchased a surround sound system yet so are relying on the internal speakers for movies and games. We often have to change the volume to hear speech, then for action sequences we usually need to ramp the volume down.. Finally, while standard def content looks better than I expected, with a unit this large it is easy to detect compression artifacts and other noise. THX seems to help somewhat, but this may be too large of a unit if you are sitting closer than 8 feet to the screen. This isn't really a fault, but rather a recommendation to consider your size needs carefully.. Overall we are still very pleased with the TV and are looking forward to many years of stunning image quality, especially with 1080 sources..",198000,2008-06-07T03:18:53Z

Of course, we could look at the screen and see the street name, but that isn't the best thing to do in heavy traffic! We also want to have the feature of REAL TIME TRAFFIC which the 265W has free for lifetime. We're not sure if the bluetooth feature is worth it or not. There are so many models of Garmins to chose from it is really confusing---and so many features. The PROS of this 205w is the larger screen is easy to see and its nice to see the little car moving along. The voice is clear. It is easy to program and seems to sense what street name we are typing in quickly. The CONS we already listed.

I had decided to get the Creative labs zen micro 6gb for 199.99 until I found out that the headphone jack broke. Which I found out that it did when I went to a store and started listing to it as soon as I jiggled the headphone jack it broke..

But most of all everyone is complaining about the video and how small it is. REMEMBER THIS IS NOT A VIDEO PLAYER FIRST. This iPod was designed to play music. Watching a podcast video or downloading an ABC episode is just a perk.. Over all the iPod 30gb for 300 bucks is a great deal, plays the music great and thats what it was designed for. Forget the FM tuners that others offer because you can get talk radio through podcasts and if you really want to mix up the music just use the iPods shuffle feature. And remember it has the longest warranty out of all mp3 player companies and you know what since its the most sold mp3 player ever theres not to many complaints about it.

11460,402,"This camera was the one I was directed to by a professional mentor, every pro seller, and numerous reviews both on and offline (including this site). I spent almost 6 months researching DSLR cameras and that culminated in two hours of side-by-side and 'in hand' comparisons, taking many shots in Ritz Cameras, the place I final made the purchase. The D80 easily outperformed everything under $2000. In the comparisons here, it was stacked against cameras well OVER $2000 and rated well.. My first con comment isn't really a reflection of the camera as much as it's a consideration for larger hands. The second tho, is a major loss for me, as I prefer macro photography to all other types.. I brought D80 home and was taking good shots in 15 minutes, without reading a single word of the manual. In 15 days, I was taking shots that were so good that one of them won an award in a citywide weekly contest. This camera is easier to use than my first two 'point and shoots' yet fully controllable now that I've moved to SLR equipment..

I have 2 friends and my dad that have the roadmate, and they all like it alot. I personally didn't care for the size of it and I wanted something I could take with me when I travel out of the country or from car to car very easily. After a few days of research I ended up picking up my nuvi from the local bestbuy with a 10% off coupon. This gadget is awesome, within 5 minutes of getting the box open, I was plotting a course to my home from where I bought the nuvi.. The nuvi navigated flawlessly to my first destination. The next day I decided to take it with me to the beach and a friend of mine got her hands on it. Keep in mind my friend is a girl with very little technical skill, and she commented how easy the nuvi was to use. Also a nice feature is the mp3 player, its no ipod but it is great when there is no radio around and you want to hear some tunes.. Only drawbacks I have experienced is the short battery life when using the mp3 player(which is fine because thats not the nuvi's primary function) and the glare from the sun could make the screen hard to see at times. Otherwise the nuvi is near perfect so far..",208000,2010-05-16T21:17:26Z

19976,465,"This drive was too good to be true -- 500GB external drive with a small case and a cheap price. The drive repeatedly malfunctioned when writing -- I tried operating it using usb 2.0 on two different Windows XP boxes.. As a side note, the case while wonderfully small is made of very cheap plastic and has the fit and finish of a product you'd expect to cost $20 -- it's odd to put a 500GB drive in a flimsy plastic case that looks like a toy.. Unplugging power to drive and then reattaching helped a little, but this is just too risky for data. It's like gambling. It repeatedly wasn't recognized as a drive by the computer and had data copy and erase errors.. It took two hours to copy over 400GB of data and then another half hour to do an RMA at buy.com because I couldn't speak to a live person at Western Digital or Buy.com. The phone tree at both locations would require the patience of a monk to navigate over half a day.. I was not once able to stream video or audio using USB 2.0 although I could open several files I copied to the drive.. I was seduced by the price for this size drive, but now I have to wait to get my money back, I wasted hours copying data and I'm going to have to do it all over again.

The most important feature in my opinion is the out-of-sight-out-of-mind backup. Two weeks ago I lost 2 years of files. I paid the price for being too lazy and too forgetful. Now, I have something that'll be thinking about backups for me.. Another nice feature was the consolidation of the three separate devices that formed my office backup &#38; network: I had a wireless print server, external backup, and router. Now I use only one plug with no brick or wallwart (which all three other devices had).. The limitations are of course what is to be expected when using a wireless network and an Apple device.

14759,917,"Fortunately, I had read some of the forums before buying the Storage Central and knew what I was letting myself in for. You must make sure you download the latest version of firmware and SCM before installing the hardware. Doing this means that the vast majority of bugs and problems associated with the unit are avoided. Certainly, for me, installation was a breeze and the drives have been completely reliable since installation a month or so ago. RTFM an absolute must.. I have a couple of 400G Hitachi drives mirrored in mine, with no significant heat problems. Even the 15 hour (!) transfer of initial data to the drives did not cause excessive heat. Not being particularly used to storage over ethernet, I was a little disappointed with access and transfer times, although I gather it is not particularly slow in that respect. It is certainly capable of streaming 1080i HD Video and I've not had any trouble streaming music or accessing files.. Whilst having the drive mirrored brings some security to my data, I am still uncomfortable in case the SC101 itself should die. Not being able to take the drive out and install it back in my computer is a real cause of concern; I find myself backing the SC101 up back to my main computer, which kind of defeats the object of remote mirrored drives. I would dearly love to see a driver which addresses this problem.. Although not an issue yet, having the drives only accessible from Windows may be a problem if I ever find time to start playing with Linux on my spare computer. having to install the SCM utility on all computers is a bit of a pain but it does mean that it genuinely appears as a local drive, useful for some software that does not like remote drives.. Finally, I also have one of the Netgear MP101 media streaming devices. It would have been great to see Netgear 'twin' these devices so I do not need to leave my computer on 24/7. Another future update perhaps?. Overall, extremely impressed with no major gripes but in the back of my mind I am left wondering if I would be better off setting up RAID on my main computer....",226000,2011-03-01T11:51:45Z

11916,441,"If you spend any time on the web then by now you've seen many articles disparaging Vista for various reasons. However, Vista is a significant update to the Windows line. Not only is the core OS upgraded for security and modularity, it also includes a completely redesigned network stack and a new audio stack that is second to none in terms of the ability to record and listen to high quality audio. In addition, Vista comes in several variations depending on your needs. If you need a basic good OS there's a cheap version for you. If you're interested in bells and whistles galore there's the Ultimate addition. Vista is compatible with current and past hardware. I'm running it on a two year old Dell laptop with a Pentium M processor and it is very quick. Startup and shutdown have been sped up significantly. Vista also includes a new search function which revolutionizes the way you interact with the OS. No longer are you forced to click through the menus in Control Panel searching for the button to turn on bigger font. Now you can just search for font and the results are instantly displayed. Also, the search function changes the way you open programs. Rather than picking your way through the start menu you can just type the name of the program into the search bar in the start menu (just hit windows key and start typing) and start it immediately. Also, for even speedier program running you can add it to the quick launch bar. You can then hit windows+any number where the number represents that program's position on the quick launch bar and it'll start. The new Explorer behaves similarly. You can find any file almost instantaneously simply by searching for it in the search box in the file explorer. Gone are the days of the slow XP search; Vista searches are nearly immediate. Explorer contains many ways to sort your data including a new stack feature which will create virtual folders on the fly wherein you can find all the files meeting any criteria of your choice which can include size, date created, date edited, author, and even the exif data on your digital photos and many more. Vista comes with many handy programs such as a very good calendar, a mail program which compares favorably to the likes of Thunderbird and Evolution, very robust backup utilities, a photo gallery program similar to Google's excellent Picasa, and depending on the level you buy perhaps many other bells and whistles. If you take one thing from this review it's that you shouldn't believe the FUD about Vista. There is an excellent Wikipedia page describing the new features in Vista. With Vista you will interact with your computer in a completely different way. You will work faster and more efficiently and you will play harder..",228000,2013-08-16T01:03:22Z
15886,970,"Well Well I think I'm going to get in trouble with mom. I'm writing this on c-ent and facebook and mom is listed as my friend. oh well I brought a birthday present for me when I went to hide my 765T from the car wash people and the screen cracked. I know I could of gotten a 265wt for a $100.00 but whatever. Well this machine costed about 459.00, I guess I could have gotton it for 399.00 but I needed it fast due to the fact my screen cracked and I needed it for business. But I guess it's better than $499.00. So do I like the machine? It's a little low for my standards but it's really awsum for what you can expect in todays world.Since I started buying GPS's I had to lower my standards or I'd be on Anti depressants for the rest of my life LOL.. To start with all the nuvi products route you the same. They get you where you are going. Do they always use the best route? No way. I've had tom tom and I did not like the interface but the 740 live ether had the most rational routes due to iq or historacal routes the offer at other times it was horrable, the megallans froze up. So I went with the Garmins. The Garmins are more consitant. Garmin's don't take you the back way (like I'd like to avoid traffic) and even somtimes a slower way then I'd know (for example I'd use a highway to connect with another highway) the Garmin would tell me take a main road to connect to the 2nd highway. Does it take you in circles yeah sometimes. But they all do Most of the time the routes were good, even when they were not that good they were ok. . So I knew when I was buying this unit I was not buying a unit that I would build for this price but the best available as far as it being balanced in ********, efficientcy and Bells and whisles. Just to recap when I speak of routing I am speaking for all garmins including this one.. Selling points I like the screen it's bright and the letters are big, I love the traffic that you get Via built in celluar band, I love the Google search, I havan't tried blue tooth but I will in a few years when I'm board, Theh speaker quality is good. What I wish Garmin did was put the Gas prices and resturant searches in distant order. They are in order in there own poi's but not in the Google search POI. but you know what Garmin's private poi's were always outdated so I guess you can't ask for everything.. Personally Do I think for $500.00 that the google searches should be in order yes, Do I think for $500.00 the routing should be perfect yes. but as much screaming I've done it get's me nowhere. All I have to say is the american companies have no pride in there production anymore. Does this make this a bad unit ? no it doesn't I like it - I just wish they fine tuned odds and ends a bit.. As far as the Ad's Yes I've heard complaints about it and to be perfectly honest the ad's are paying or the 2 year free service. They are not putting the ad's on to subisdize the unit. Do I like the ad's no. but I can live with it. I'd rather have the Ad;s which subidizes the service than have the monthly fee. They don't show up when you are driving anyway so I don't know the big deal. Let me ask should you be looking at the road while driving or at the unit.. Would I recomend this product yeah it's cool. If you are not a toy buff then just get yourself the cheap one they all route you the same.. ..",229000,2010-12-14T05:03:27Z
2975,776,"I consider the iPod an alternative to the Zune. I still use a Zune 30 but because Microsoft updates even the older released Zunes, I can still be up on 90% of the new features. Just let me say this, the Zune is well worth the money, and assuming either you have a PC or a Mac that is running windows, the Zune is a very nice device and I highly recommend it after owning two iPods previously. There are only a few small problems, mainly that since the 3.0 firmware update, a bug previously fixed by 2.5, when someone plugs in their Zune and it simply won't sync with the software or even act plugged in, has returned with the use of a more generic driver in windows for ejecting the Zune. It's a simple fix to solve the problem, but it's a temporary fix untill MS releases a patch for the problem. Also the Zune software is fairly heavy on recourses. Over all though, the organizational abilities of the Zune software completely outweigh iTunes, as well as the softwares sync speed, store integration and just overall ease of use..

7166,381,"I have been involved is DSLR photography for many years and shoot part time. Here is my take on why you shouldn't buy a D80:. I would assume that most people who are looking at the D80 are probably entry level shooters. I own a D80, but I recently used the bought the excellent D40 and would completely recommend the D40 over the D80.. Why would I recommend Nikons entry level DSLR over the D80?; a camera that would appear more advanced? Read on..... Firstly, the D40 uses exactly the same sensor as the D80. Same technology for almost half the price.. The D40 is much more sensitive to light because it defaults to ISO 200 unlike the D80 &#38; D40x which default to ISO 100. This makes for sharper images. Even the overpriced D40x can't compete with the D40 because of it's sensitivity to light (the most important part of photography).. The D40 flash sync speed (ask any pro photographer how important this is) is 1/500 second whereas the D80 is 1/250 second (may not sound like much, but it makes huge difference when shooting with a flash). Worried about 6 Megapixels versus higher? Don't be sold on the camera manufacturers claims that bigger is better when it comes to MP's. Large Megapixel sizes don't mean a thing. Megapixel size is targeted towards the average uninformed consumer and is a way for corporations to get people to upgrade to newer cameras. Unless you are shooting large poster size prints you don't need anything bigger than 6MP's. At 6 MP's you can makes great prints up to 12 x 18 inches. Personally I have never printed anything bigger than that.. The flash on the D40 is the same as the D80. If you want to create great indoor photo's, I recommend buying the SB400 speedlight for the bounce feature. Bounce flash is the holy grail of indoor flash photography because direct flash ruins photo's and washes out the colors.. The lens on the D40 (18 - 55mm) is a jewell of a lens. It is one of the best Nikon lenses I have used (I have some expensive lenses). It also weighs next to nothing so along with the camera, it makes for a very comfortable carrying experience. My D40 + lense weighs the same as my D80 body with no lens! Other DSLR's I have owned become tiresome because they are so big and heavy. The D40 is really a joy to use; hard to explain but one in your hands and you will understand. It just feels so comfortable in your hands!. The LCD on the D40 is so sharp and clear (same LCD as D80), only the D300 is better.. Some of the more technical aspects the D40 offers are full RGB histogram (through the well hidden Color Balance option), full auto ISO (it really works, you can even shoot at 3200!), 3 point Auto Focus (3 is enough, don't buy into the hype of needing more), battery life is excellent (I have gotten over 1,000 shots off one charge).. Most importantly, you can get fantastic colors using the saturation feature in the menu options. Colors are vibrant using this along with the Color III mode.. Bottom line, the D40 will take as good if not better quality photo's than the D80. I don't even use my D80 anymore since the D40 takes great photo's and is so light to carry around.. I would purchase a D40 vs a D80 (next step up is really the pro D300) any day of the week. The extra money you save can be spent on the excellent SB400 Speedlight flash and the excellent Nikor 18-200mm VR II zoom lens!. At the end of the day, remember having a more expensive camera will not make any better shots than a cheap camera (google photo's people have taken on camera phones if you don't believe it).. You can pick up the D40's now for about $479, lens included with shipping. Just make sure you visit www.resellerratings.com and research the company you are purchasing from. There are a lot of scam sites out there. I buy most of my camera equipment from buydig.com and beachcamera.com (no I don't work for them).. Hope that helps..",231000,2011-09-21T08:43:03Z

19891,481,"This is a great point and shoot camera. In full auto mode the SD790IS takes outstanding images for the price.. What I was looking for in a digital camera:. Ease of use, sub 200 dollar price, and fantastic picture quality.. Why:. My last camera was a Nikon Coolpix 5700, which captures great images in the right conditions (IMHO), but is intimidating to many people due to the less than intuitive layout/design/controls for non-SLR users. My significant other was intimidated by this camera and as a result I end up on the other side of the lens all the time and rarely appear in pictures with my family.. What I got in the SD790IS:. The Cannon SD790IS very easy to operate in auto mode. The price is right and the images are, IMHO, amazing for this price range. It destroyed the comparable Nikons.. Beyond meeting all my initial criteria, the SD790IS has outstanding video and I have not experienced any problems with the placement of the microphone pinhole and wind noise, as suggested by the CNET review. The Color Accent feature is also interesting to play with.. Battery life is significant, though I purchased an additional battery for reserve when traveling out of country. Double AA battery cameras are great for this purpose, but the battery life of the SD790IS makes this a non-issue, at least for my purposes.. The display is big and beautiful, though I sometimes feel it is too forgiving with questionable images.. I thoroughly recommend this camera if it fits your needs..",234000,2008-06-16T23:17:29Z
11007,328,"Since all of the games are either multi-platform or on the PC, this is probably the one console you can absolutely do without. (Use the console exclusively for games that play better with a controller like sports, racing, and fighting games.). Not using more then 4 controllers at once would suck when playing Pro Evolution Soccer with my friends (on my playstation I can jam with 7).. (Personally i prefer the playstation controller design, plus the ps3 has motion sensing like the Wii.). Paying for online services (if money is a concern getting a PS3 will save you in the long run). No web browser. Its nice being able to look-up the manuals for games.. Would also eliminate the need for netflix, since you can watch any movie or tv show online for free.. More of a mouse and keyboard FPS player (so there goes half the 360 library). All of the 360 games are better on the PC (ie Mass Effect, Dead Space, Gears of War).. The only good exclusives that are not on the PC: Saints Row (sequel multi-platform, and its not as good as GTA4), Dead Rising (which is really fun but not worth the cost of itself plus the console). If you must play Halo for whatever reason, get the arcade and buy your own HDD online ($ave, and you get krapy arcade games, and a useless memory card). Although the ps3 HDD swap is alot easier since it uses a conventional laptop HDD. PS3 allows its users to use any storage device as a memory card (usb jump drive).. Sony also encourages modding of both games and its console, unlike microsoft which doesn't provide any tools for installing an alternate OS.

5903,326,"While I wanted a smartphone, I wasn't willing to pay $30 for a data plan simply because I knew I wouldn't be using the phone enough to make it worth it. As a T-Mobile customer, when I saw the Nuron with it's $10 data plan, I jumped on it. When I was looking at it in a T-Mobile store, the sales clerk was actually trying to dissuade me from getting it, saying that a lot of people don't like it and end up returning it. After talking to him a little more, he stated that most of the people who return it had previously owned a smartphone.. I would imagine that if you had already owned an iPhone or Android phone, the Nuron would seem downright primitive. I've seen it referred to as a dumb smartphone. However if you've never owned a smartphone before or don't need one with all the bells and whistles, the Nuron may be for you. The interface can be sluggish at times but you get used to it. It's got plenty of features (for me at least) and while the number of apps either through the Ovi store or third party can't compare to other phones, there are plenty available. Ovi maps alone may be worth the price of this phone for some.. I have had no problems with calls or connectivity issues and battery life is excellent. It's not the slickest smartphone, most feature-packed, or easiest to use, but for those on a budget or not needing the latest and greatest, this phone may be for you. Also, even though the data plan with unlimited web is only $10, it is not required and the phone will work without it. You can even use Ovi maps (in offline mode) without having the data plan.

8908,972,"I picked up a refurb one of these off ebay to check out. It was pretty simple to set up, although it won't even function unless you install a hard drive, as I learned while attempting to update the firmware before installing drives into it. On another technical note, the automatic firmware update enforced by the latest installation utility can't be initiated if running XP large DPI display mode as the yes/no boxes are obscured.. Networking flexibility wasn't what I had hoped for (DHCP only, no real options other than changing sizes and enabling standby mode, needs software client to function). It also does not function using a conventional file system so you can't set NTFS file permissions, defrag it, benchmark via conventional hard drive methods, or run chkdsk on it.. I benchmarked the peak write performance by monitoring total bytes/sec of the network redirector, and it's about 4.5 megs/sec. Reads peak at under 6 megs/sec, so the fact it doesn't have a gigabit interface is irrelevant. It did not seem to be picky about the hard drive used during my testing, as I put a whiny old 5400RPM 40GB drive in it, which worked flawlessly. The passively cooled drive slots are designed for 1 height drives so don't plan to put slimline drives (eg: Seagate 7200.10 160G) into the enclosure as there are no screw mounts.. I would not recommend this product for high performance applications, or for highly technical users as they will be left wanting from a performance and functionality perspective.. The device pretty much manages itself which is what most SOHO users running their own network are looking for.

There is a large variety of apps available and although the camera doesn't have a flash, there is an app called NightShotD that will lighten any still picture making it nearly perfect.

11747,1,"Superb phone! This phone does all of the very nice adult functions that we love about Blackberry and combines the touchscreen, apps, and games that made us jealous of our kids' i-phone and android phone. It is an amazing innovation that closes the gap between childish touchscreen phones and adult business phones. It does this by allowing you to use it like a conventional Blackberry or using it like your kid's i-phone. It does both and does both very well! I thought I would never use touchscreen and am finding that I use it quite a lot actually.. I was always jealous when my kids would show me pictures on their huge touchscreen. Now I whip out my Blackberry and do the exact same thing back and laugh. What people don't know, or seem to not realize, is how much more capable Blackberry is a a PDA for organizing your life.

5344,893,"I don't mean to be so rude in my rating, but I've simply had it with this phone. I switched from t-mobile to verizon and purchased this phone, thinking that verizon is far better with picking up reception and offers great service; I spoke too soon.. I bought this phone with my new verizon wireless contract, and at first was amazed at it's price value. However, I least expected that a Verizon phone would have a problem picking up reception where my old t-mobile phone had no problem. How bad of a reception am I talking about? I'm not exaggerating --literally 0 bar, or in other words, can't use the phone at all or able to receive texts hours late. I thought it was because I had a faulty phone, so Verizon sent me a new one. I still had the same problem.. You might be thinking it's because of the neighborhood that I live in, and I thought so too. However, I had bad reception at my workplace, and at my home that I live in during weekends. Verizon customer service even assured me that the area I was in should not have any reception problem but they would go ahead and send a specialist to check the area.. It's been 3 weeks and I've heard not a single update, I'm paying about $90/month for nothing, and the worst of all, I can't use my phone.. As my last resort, I'm literally moving to a different city (closer to my workplace) in hope of being able to make phone calls. This phone has caused me so much trouble that I'm even thinking about paying a couple hundred dollars just to end my contract early.. In conclusion, get this phone if you know for sure it works in your area, and you can handle a laggy phone. If not, and especially if you think you might possibly run into the same problem, do NOT get this phone!!!.",257000,2008-02-08T01:54:05Z

Despite what others have said, this is a fantastic unit, especially for the $. I had a Garmin C330 previously and this thing smokes it! I also have a Garmin Nuvi 200 I bought for my ball and chain. The Mrs saw this unit in action and was immediately jealous! WIDESCREEN! The text to speech works great, doesn't sound like a robot like most others. This unit had BY FAR the strongest gps signal lock out of any GPS Ive ever used! I turned the mount upside down and I keep the unit in my cup holder, and it works great....Ive even used this in my house....try doing that with another unit....my Garmin will ask if Im inside a building and it doesn't work until I go outside. The touch screen is very responsive and the unit processes button selections very quickly. This has Navtech maps which have always seemed best in my opinion. The maps seem up to date....I live in the Phoenix area and there are many new roads and freeways not on my other units that ARE on this one! (someone complained about not being able to download new map updates....this is because this is a brand NEW model and there are NO updates available!) The minor gripes I have with this unit are as follows....1. who in their right mind would use an ABC keyboard layout in place of the Qwerty that were all familiar with?!?! (at least it automatically greys out letters that arent possible to use). 2. it is fancy enough to say  you are now arriving at Best Buy. but it doesn't say what side of the street the destination is on! This is not the end of the world, but most other inexpensive units have this. These are really the only cons I can think of at the moment....I was hesitant to buy a Magellan since Ive always used Garmin but I like this unit so much I just bought a Magellan Maestro 3200 for my parents! (I stole it from Best Buy today. it came w/ a $30 bag/case and the whole bundle only cost me $129! (same interface, smaller screen, no text to speech but still a solid deal!) There are alot of people complaining about GPS systems not having Bluetooth or MP3 players or picture viewers?!?! WHO CARES!! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!! Talk about wanting a Filet Mignon on a Big Mac budget! There is no such thing as a perfect GPS unit...non of them are completely accurate all of the time but if you want a great unit at a great price, check out the 1412!

3173,755,"To be honest I picked this up as a second phone to experiment with Android while I wait for my ATT 2yr contract on my Blackberry Bold to expire. I first saw the Android 1.6 Zio on I was considering the ATT Samsung Captivate, but I am also coveting my friends DroidX on Verizon. The Cricket offer came along and for the web special of $129, overnight shipping and no contract, it was an easy decision to make. Worst case I port my AT&#38;T number to it and save $40 a month over my current ATT Plan and just wait for a better Droid on ATT or Verizon.. I have been using a Google Voice number for past few months and also have forwarded calls from my BB to the Ascend, though I still check the BB periodically for any text's.. I downloaded various apps to the Ascend and so far so good. Android OS still has way to go to catch up to Blackberry. The areas it needs improvement for me. 1) Contact manager: display the contacts company name below their name. Allow display of name with numbers below the name for contacts with multiple contact numbers.. 2) Provide a good notes app with security. I love sync'ing my outlook notes to my BB. Note: My BB is password protected.. 3) A good app to sync outlook with Blackberry... I am trying out DejaOffice, and it has a nice contact manager, notes and a synch utility which I have to test.. Overall, the Huawei Ascend is a great value for anyone who wants to try an Andriod phone with out the risk of a contract. It would be nice if phone had more memory and faster CPU. Hopefully Android 2.2 will be an available upgrade. If not the jump to another carriers better Android device will only hurt my wallet, but as far as usability goes most all I learn by working with the Ascend wont be wasted.. Crickets coverage where I live (Fresno) is good. Their pricing is great so that may be enough to keep me, especially now that they have a nationwide roaming agreement with Sprint..",263000,2010-04-11T00:39:41Z

17037,392,"I wasn't sure what to expect with the Canon SD600. I had been using an Olympus 3030z purchased in the year 2001. I used to carry around the big case full of spare batteries, extra memory cards and RCA cords. I was ready for a compact. I bought the Canon based on the size, specs and its popularity. It has not disappointed.. The most surpising feature of the SD600 is the video. Amazing. I'm not sure if the technology has improved that much since I last shopped for a camera (admittedly 5 years ago), or if Canon does an exceptional job, but it is a joy to use. I almost use the video more than the stills.. My only complaint after two months of use involves the flash. It seems I wish it would fire more often in the automatic program mode. I know, the high ISO is supposed to compensate, and does. This will take some getting used to. And even when the flash does fire, I end up wishing it was a little stronger. Again, I realize that the compact form factor does not lend itself to a monster flash, so this will take some getting used to.. Lastly, I enjoy the software included with SD600 and recommend you get at least a 1GB SD memory card. (I bought a 2GB and love it.).",266000,2008-03-26T22:25:12Z

12312,406,"Quit complaining about poor-quality headphones! No mp3 player out there has more than decent headphone quality... it doesn't exist; don't be disappointed if it falls short. Buy your mp3 player without the expectation that you'll get a quality of headphone that is worth the $50-300 quality range that you're expecting. Instead, complain about the computer not recognizing your player and the angst of having to search online for updated drivers. Complain about no drag and drop music file features. Complain about your player freezing up in the middle of a shuffle and it going back to song 1 when you restart it. Complain about having to download new music player softwares that clogs up your machine and doesn't work perfectly with your OS just so you can sync your player. Complain about all those things with OTHER mp3 players - because this Sony model doesn't have any of those frustrating setbacks that I have been plagued with by every other player.. I've had an ipod and was forced to download iTunes (I like using my Windows Media Player better - not to mention the drag and drop sync Sony has), the hard drive was too delicate for me to go jogging in inclimate temperatures and the machine eventually froze up, the hard drive became corrupted, and became a very expensive paperweight. I've bought other hard drive players - which couldn't be recognized by my machine, even after downlading and installing the correct drivers and making sure my computer had all its updates. I've had terrific inexpensive flash players (durability, ease of use) that didn't have certain standard features such as; sorting through music by genre, year, album, artist or song, or most importantly - shuffle. I've read about so many things that can go wrong with their competition - and this Sony player doesn't have one negative attribute. It was the only player I found that it had mainly positive reviews.. The Zune makes you use it's own software... why on earth would a Microsoft mp3 player not be compatible with a Microsoft OS's media software is beyond me. Unacceptable! Apple doesn't have an fm radio (and I'm not shelling out an extra $50 for Apple radio just to listen to the TVs when I work out at the gym, etc). On another note - the Zune and Apple 8 Gb cost as much as their 30 Gb, and it breaks my heart and my wallet to spend that much on a flash player. I want to go with the largest amount of memory on a flash player rather than buy a hard drive player because they are more hardy and durable than a hard drive and it can take more abuse. The new Sandisk players seem to have a lot of problems with freezing up and driver issues - and I'll spend the extra $40 bucks or so if it saves me the angst and energy I'd have over difficult and malfunctioning machines.. I have had MANY disappointments with mp3 players (except for my $35 Creative Labs 1Gb, it served it's purpose - but you get what you pay for); breakdowns, software issues, crappy features, and some not working from the get go (don't buy used non-Apple mp3 players; even from the company that distributes it! In my case anyway - two for two on that note) but this Sony has met all my expectations and I would highly reccommmend it. The only drawback is expensive, priority Sony accessories... but that's just Sony and I accept that, just as I accept poor quality headphones..",268000,2014-06-28T04:06:04Z

14396,807,"I really wanted to give 0 start because of horrendous experience with this phone. I mean the way phone was designed is fine. I liked working with it. But it crashed too many times and at times, it would crash with the fatal 552 error. If you type error 552 blackberry on google, you'll see what I mean. This problem is so rampant, it happened to me many times causing me to replace the phone 4 times already. Of course, Verizon techs and RIM techs deny that this is widespread or common problem, but the simeple google search will tell you otherwise.. Let me back track a bit. When I first got this phone, it was very easy to get accustomed to with low learning curve, very easy to use UI, functional, I just loved the phone. I didn't care it didn't have the trendy touch screen. The phone was practically perfect for me.. However, when I installed several apps like AP news, Poynt and so on, it started acting weird. I would see that delay icon (clock) often and system became very sluggish. Also, battery drain was very severe. It actually drained in half a day on a full charge without calling anyone. This happens often and to clear it up, you need to do battery pull which clears the memory. However, even with battery pull, battery barely lasted a day with very light call volume. I couldn't use this phone the following day without charging it overnight every night.. Now, about the battery pull, I'm still not sure what the exact problem was. RIM tech wouldn't tell me the real answer either. In fact, he told me this is a very rare problem. Load of bull...they had a work around for this problem on their web site months ago which didn't work. So they've been aware of this problem for quite some time. Again do the Google search on error 552. Very common problem.. So what exactly is a error 552? I have no idea. But what it does is the phone hangs with error message 552 and doesn't finish booting up. Only way to work around it is (which Verizon techs didn't know how to do) reinstall the operating system basically wiping everything in the memory. You'll essentially lose everything since last backup.. Initially, Verizon techs claimed it's certain unstable 3rd party software that were causing this problem. Google it and it becomes obvious very fast that there isn't certain program that causes it, but this happens from installing or unstalling wide array of softwares which mostly are approved by RIM and Verizon (since they are available on Blackberry Appworld) but also from battery pull which is essential to keep the system marginally functional.. So how rampant is this problem? In January, I had to replace my phone twice because every known work around didn't work. On February, I had to replace it twice because of same reason. However, to give them credit, RIM finally found work around which Verizon techs weren't aware of. However, after doing the work around, it happened to same phone on the same day. So Verizon determined it might be hardware problem and replace it second time for February.. I got so sick of spending hours of trying to restore it and failing, days of waiting for new phones to arrive, I asked them to give me a different phone. Anything but this one. Currently, I'm waiting for a new Storm 2 to arrive in replacement. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or what as storm tends to have bad track record with quality issues. Reading reviews from other users, it seems that all Blackberries have mechanical key not working issues and this necessity of battery pull due to sluggish performance.. After replacing the phone average of 2 times a month, I'd advice anyone to stay clear of this phone. I don't care how good UI is or email client is. If it keeps having irrecoverable crashes, product doesn't belong in the market as it is too unstable for release. My 2 cents...",270000,2009-01-25T12:20:07Z

The Windows Aero feature seems to stall upon launching a menu item, or application. I'm not sure if its due to the ATI X1400 graphics chipset. The only feature I have not disabled is UAC. I am about to, as I have gotten complaints that any application running to include standard prebundled apps and Microsoft apps, Windows pops up a security screen, and freezes everything until you give the app permission to run. The search feature should have been placed on the taskbar like Google Desktop or Apple Spotlight.. The only bundled app working correctly is Microsoft Office 2007. It has not crashed, and at first throws off the average user of Office, by hiding all the toolbars. It took some hunting to figure out how the Drawing, Writing, Formatting, and Tables toolbars were integrated into The Ribbon gallery.. The family of Vista OS's is not worth their money. I think its insulting that Microsoft should divide and conquer by charging more for the highly touted security features found in Ultimate. Those features are what a standard user should have and they should be integrated and remain out of sight until they are needed by the system. Its no surprise sales have been tepid at best.. Overall this upgrade is more reminiscent of Windows ME to 2000. Poorly planned and executed. After 5 years of development to have no hardware and software support out the gate is startling. I am glad I have a Mac at home, because I'm not convinced that paying full price for a half baked OS is worth the trouble. And no, I am not a MacHead. I am running BootCamp at home, because I wanted the best of both worlds. I love the customization of XP, and the simplicity of OS10. I expected more from Microsoft..",277000,2009-12-27T17:39:27Z
17575,939,"I am testing this with it now:. i am putting a bigger power supply, I know sometimes, when electronics don't have enought juice to run, they get really hot.. I also took the crappy plstic box away, and I am adding a small fan on top of the drive and controller, to make some air pass by and see if with those 2 things, it gets better. i am guessing the WD people could be so cheap that they used a .68 A power supply, when the HD itself uses like .70 A now I am going to make it run with a 1.0 A power supply (like 0.3 more) to see what happens... i am just pissed of because I have like 425 GB of data in it, and every time I try to back up it fails on me...I think the HD itself is in good working condition, the issue is in the design of the controller/power supply, and enclosemet. in fact, the metallic enclosure inside, has space for a fan that was never there( another cheap move from WD?). i am no electrician, just an adventurer, so don't try this at home.. Wish you all luck with the bad purchase.. BTW, I tried another enclosure and it worked fine for like another 30 minutes, then it did not work again, getting too hot also... this might give a break to the engineers of WD... I dunno.. let me know if someone found a good solution to make this HD work properly for long time as it should..",278000,2011-07-23T16:47:51Z
7620,441,"I've own my TH-50PZ05U for about 2 weeks as I am writing this.. I got it from a local store and I am glad I did (rather than buying online) because I had to return the first unit because it was buzzing very loudly to my taste. The second unit was a lot quieter but there is still a noticeable buzz when the room is really quiet and picture very bright. But it's acceptable. I am very picky. My wife doesn't even hear it. Also this 50in unit has cooling fans which no matter what will produce some noise.. The other small issue is that the upper left corner had what I believed was a dead pixel but is in fact a small piece of dust stuck between the glass and the screen. It's only visible from less than 3 feet away so that's absolutely not an issue. But this and the first unit loud buzzing are signs that Panasonic has quality control issues. I didn't buy the extended waranty at the store but now I might consider it.. However I do think this plasma TV is a GREAT deal for the money (paid $1900 for it). The picture contrast and colors are fantastic. I've been watching several Bluray movies, HD TV program and played GT5 on my PS3 and the performance in all cases was great. I found that the best picture setting were movie and standard. Other settings (game and vivid) give an artificial look to the images (saturated colors). I didn't bother calibrating because I'm really satisfied with the movie setting.. The connectivity is good. Total of 8 different inputs (3 HDMI) and switching input is very easy. The menu system is sober (no fancy visual effects) yet easy to use: so far I didn't have to open the user guide. The SD card reader and PC input are nice to have but if you intend to mainly use this TV with a computer or for watching photos an LCD is probably a better choice.. Finally, I was a bit worried about plasma being power hungry (the spec says 700Watts) but because plasma only use their peak power when picture is totally white I found that this unit barely uses more electricty than my former Sony 27in CRT TV. LCDs use their nominal power all the time so in real usage the difference with a plasma probably not huge.. So would I recommend this TV? I am still over the fence. I am a very picky person. If you like the looks and picture of this TV, go for it: it's a great deal. All manufactures have quality issues and that's what warranties are for. But if you want total perfection and can afford it go for the high end 800 series. I do think that Panasonic may have cut some corners to come up with a 1080 50in plasma for this price..",279000,2012-12-21T15:29:05Z

My only complaints are that there is a slight vertical line of brightening on the right side of the screen. (This may be limited to my TV and it might be due to interference from the cable box.) And, I don't understand why Vizio cheaped out on the remote for the 32 TV. Without backlighting, finding buttons at night in a dark room can be a pain.

The build quality is shocking - for a thousand bucks I felt at first cheated by what is an extremely plasticky and flimsy body. The Sonys always feel solid and well put together. This feels like a cheap toy.. BUT - it's the picture that counts, and this little toy produces fantastic HD. I was really surprised by the colour depth. The HDMI output is the cherry - you can bump your flics straight into an HD plasma screen and enjoy the quality.. We wanted this for its portability, ease of use and its picture quality, and on all counts so far it has delivered.. Quibbles: the sound is rather cruddy. Despite a nice 24p feature, shutter and aperture cannot both be set manually simultaneously (meaning the camera is always adjusting one or the other - aaargh). And the screen is kind of small..

6727,946,"I got lucky and was able to get this phone a week ago - two weeks before its official release date of June 5th. My curiousity was peaked by searching for new Verizon phones on the internet, and once I heard word of people being able to order this phone early, I jumped on the train. I was and still am 100% confident in purchasing this phone - it's amazing! For the past week I have been in absolute awe of this phone over its predecessor the LG Voyager. The touch screen is much more improved, the size of the phone is more compact, and every little nook and cranny that was a downfall on the LG Voyager has been eliminated from this phone! I am in love with this device as it meets my needs of text messages, mobile IM, having a good sound-quality when talking on the phone, and having a long battery life. My one and only thing that I wish Verizon would fix in future software updates is to pleeeeease raise the limit for how many text messages can be in the inbox and outbox. It seems silly to have a phone built for text messaging that doesn't have a big enough inbox/outbox storage. All in all though I am VERY pleased with this phone, and this is the best in the Verizon LG line thus far!! And for a killer price of $149.99 after rebate (only $20 more than the price of the LG enV3) why not take the plunge and go for a touchscreen phone with a qwerty??

16285,743,"I bought this great little camera almost two weeks ago and have enjoyed every minute of use. I bought it to sort of replace my 3 year-old Canon A80, which was getting left home more and more because of its bulk. I travel a lot and wanted a quality ultracompact that would take pictures of the same caliber (or better) as my A80, but be much more pocket-friendly. I considered a number of cameras: Canon SD4xx/5xx/6xx, Sony's T series, Casio's Z series, and Panasonic's FX01. I went with the SD600 for its photo quality, build, optical viewfinder, and being the Goldilocks for size: not too big, not too small, just right.. Thoughts so far:. The SD600 is has a nice little heft to it but is not too heavy, and felts like it's been machined out one piece of metal. For such a small device it feels nice and solid in hand. One-handed operation is fairly comfortable; though the case is a little on the slippery side. I see I'll have to be careful with battery/card cover: it's the one thing that feels delicate. The buttons are large enough for my average-sized male hands.. The camera starts up very quickly, and shutter lag is negligible under most conditions. Turning off the nine-point autofocus (AiFA), which leaves on the centered AF, speeds things up a little. Flash is strong in the center of the shot, but regardless of zoom, weak on the sides. Fleshtones on the whole are rendered warm and natural, but again, it can be a little harsh in the center. Redeye is present as often as not, but it's better than I expected. The flash cycles fairly quickly with a charged battery. Battery life is OK: about 140 shots in fine mode, some flash use, and heavy LCD use. Thank you Canon for making a small flat charger whose prongs fold flat!. While this ELPH's LCD is not stunning like some of its competitors, resolution and brightness are satisfactory in all but the harshest sunlight. Bearing in mind this is an ultracompact, the viewfinder is decent and a reason why I chose this over the SD630, Casios, and Sonys.. I am very pleased with the photos this little guy is delivering. There're enough scene modes, and the automatic settings produce consistent results. The camera's manual controls are somewhat limited, but it is a point-and-shoot after all. Still, there's enough manual control to improve on the some of the auto modes and get more shots. I've found the white balance modes rather useless but surprisingly have had better and even more natural results using the special color modes. In the auto modes, colors are nicely saturated and accurately rendered. Focus time seems about average. Autofocus with or without AiAF is precise, so images are crisp without looking 'hard.' Contrast and detail are very good. In the 4x6's and 5x7's I've printed out, I'm sure a trained eye would see some issues, but what counts is that my eye is delighted with the results!. In making up my mind, video quality was not a consideration. After playing around with it though, I like what I see on the LCD, but I don't have enough experience with video to comment one way or another.. This Canon is the best compromise for me: excellent photos, solid construction, and very pocket- and travel-friendly. Battery life could be better. That's true of alot of electronic products, but I can live with it because the battery charger is very compact. All in all, this camera has met my expectations and has not disappointed me at all. In fact, it's been a lot of fun to use and play around with, which I think is much of the point of this class of camera..",299000,2011-11-05T02:48:26Z

2461,750,"I have been waiting for a camera like this for a long time. I am a semi-pro photographer. I am, and have always been a Nikon guy for my SLRs. However, Canon has always been my camera of choice for point-and-shoot cameras.. I like the image quality and functional design of the Canon point-and-shoot cameras better. The challenge that I had is that the ever increasing MP insanity started to reduce the quality of the images even on the Canons.. When I first read the promo information about this camera I couldn't believe that a camera company had finally stopped the insanity. The reduction of the MP and the slight image sensor size increase have really paid off.. I just bought the camera yesterday and I have taken 200+ pictures. As previously indicated, the user interface is amazing. There are 2 control rings available at all times. One is small - placed under the right thumb. The other is around the lense. Both have excellent ergonomic feel - just the right amount of resistance then a positive soft lock in the position where you want it to stay. The screen is excellent. I don't know how many pixels it is, but it is vibrant, large and clear.. Everything is easy to set on the camera. Doing non - studio portraits and events, I am used to checking ISO, WB, f-stop, and shutter before every set of shots. Each one of these is at my fingertips on the S90.. The image quality is amazing. Even at high ISOs the pictures are amazing. I have never had a point-and-shoot that had usable images above 400 ISO. This camera can produce usable 4x6 in prints at 1600 ISO. They are not perfect, but I was essentially shooting in the dark. This is also a function of the f2 lense.. I really can't say enough about the intelligent design of this camera.. My only reservations are regarding: the grip, as mentioned above; no optical viewfinder, which i like to use in very bright situations, and the choice of battery - this is the first point and shoot that I have had in a very long time that didn't take AA batteries. I like AA batteries because they serve the way I use a point and shoot camera. They are available in every city and country, they don't require any pre-planning for charging, and the lithium ones are light and let me shoot almost endlessly. I guess I will have to deal with toting around the charger - which is admittedly very small.. This is the camera that every photo-enthusiast should have in the pocket or briefcase (like mine) at all times. If you don't set all of your controls before you take a picture buy one of the basic A-series Canons-you will save money and be just as happy..",301000,2011-02-02T15:30:06Z

14811,412,"While the game line-up is good. $50 (its soon to be $60) a year to play online and access many of the features just isnt worth it. While setup is simple plug and play, you will need to get either an ethernet cord, or spend $100 on a wireless adapter of you want to connect online. The few features it does have are only available to gold members. Things like Facebook, Last.FM, Twitter and Netflix are all only available to those who have a gold membership. Its Facebook integration is lacking compared to the PS3. Last.FM will play one song by the artist you searched for, then it just plays songs like it. Twitter works good and actually isnt all that bad. Would give features a 2.5 (out of 5). The way you can buy things from the marketplace is with Microsoft Points, which is kinda like Wii Points but more complicated. $1 is equal to 80 Microsoft Points. which is annoying when you are trying to determine how much something is. but when you go to buy like more expensive things like full games, they are priced in dollars which means you cant use the $100's you may have spent on points to buy them. I give the currency system a 1.5 for being so confusing. The online part of it is fairly nice. The overall GUI isnt hard to use, but it is still hard to just find out whats on your hard drive without having to go through a few menus. Any alert you get (such as an achievment) can be instantly looked at by hitting the guide button (no, not the one to find whats on tonight, the big green and siver 'x' button in the middle of the controller) to bring up a screen showing whatever it was that the alert was about. For instance, if you just got some achievment and you have no clue what it was for, hitting the guide button while the message is being dispayed will bring up the achivement list for that game. If your buddy messages you saying whats up, same deal, tap the guide button, and you will be brought to that message. Your bud comes online, tap the guide button, the friends list pops up. But one thing you arent alerted of, is when someone goes offline, meaning finishing that level before you go and see if your friend wants to play a game, just to find out that he went off a minute before you decided to message him, kinda just makes you annoyed at the fact you had to open the friend list just to find out that your bud's offline. Inviting people is a no-brainer, if the game supports multiplayer, just go find someone whos online (and has gold) and hit invite to game. Messageing is simple, you can leave a voice message, text message, send both, or even if you have gold, and an Xbox Vision camera, send a snapshot of your gameface. One thing that isn supported is sending pictures from the hard drive as attatchments in a message. General online play is somewhat nice, sice all xboxes come with a headset, most people have one. But sometimes, and this is a regular occurance, multiplayer games LAG, alot. So if you are about to make that winning kill on Quantum of Solace, and someone (probably using the wireless adapter because usually thats the case) lags the game. Tough luck, and your gonna need to try again. So i give online play a 4 because while its good when it works, its really not worth that hard earned $60. I give messaging a 3.5 because you cant send pictures from the hard drive, you cant have emoticons, and you cant copy and paste text. The GUI is a solid 4 with the shortcuts and somewhat easy to use menu.. Customization is VERY limited. you cant make your own themes or change the background to your favorite pet. While the avatar is pretty much what you make it into, getting new things for it can be expensive (come on, $5 for a prop?). Though you can have a name, motto, location, and bio in your profile. The number of people who really read bios are rather slim. Plus, be careful if you live in somewhere like Fort Gay, Microsoft wont bother find out that Fort Gay is a town in West Virginia (look it up, a user was suspended because microsoft took it as being innapropriate). I give customization a 2 for the little there is.. So all in all, if you have the money for online, and like the games, the xbox is great. But if you like Features, Free stuff, Blu-ray, a great media center, Good intigration, or a virtual online world. then maybe PS3 is for you. If you want a good family friendly console with good features and is fun for all ages, the Wii is for you. Let me leave off with a note that both the Wii and PS3 have a good built-in internet browser, and Netfix streaming through a disk..",305000,2014-05-19T15:45:01Z

The Canon cameras just felt horrid in my hands. I know these days people are split between Canons and Nikons but, I simply cannot substitute comfort.. I used to work as a graphic designer before joining the Air Force and I knew what I was looking for. The added reason for myself purcashing a new camera was due to a future addition to our family - my soon to be born baby boy. I wanted a camera where I could capture many of his early life moments with great image clarity. When I really compared (I researched over 30 websites...I found that the D80 really wasn't something I needed...at this moment. The D40 when compared to the D50...really does outshine in several departments. The compromises with the D40 really doesn't hurt me at all. The chief complaint most have from what I've seen is the inability to use non-AF-S/I lenses. I don't have ANY lenses. So I will not be losing any money there by going with the newer D40.. I took several test photos already...and the images are CRYSTAL clear...even when zoomed up completely. This camera was well worth my money..",315000,2008-11-25T06:20:49Z

1461,843,"The TomTom Go 720 has tons of great features like: FM Transmitter (great idea), MP3 player, photo viewer, etc. All of those things though, can't make up for the fact that the actual GPS function is sub-par. It was not accurate at all, and chose foolish routes to easy-to-find locations. Also, when missing a turn, it was not terrible at making new calculations, but it took a little longer than I would have liked (enough time to miss the new turn it has instructed you to take).. I also found that the menus were quite convoluted, it took a long time to get through all the menus and submenus to get what you were looking for. This is however, mostly due to the fact that it has a lot of extra features, so with that you have to take the good with the bad.. Overall, I decided to return this GPS. TomTom just isn't the quality that the brand name would have you believe. I'll most likely stick with a Gamin, which in my experience has been super-accurate as far as GPS goes, even if there are fewer functions.

I was at least hoping to get decent results, consistent with a good point and shoot. I have been trying to reconcile the results I received however, and now have to conclude, the reviews and opinions of others were based on promise, not actual results. I'm an avid photographer that has several camerals, include a couple SLRs and numerous point and shoots. This is the first of my cameras that didn't meet expectations, which admittedly were high.. Photo quality is mediocre, especially in mid to low light, and it is slow to focus, often not focusing correctly. My Sony T-9 is far superior in photo quality and shot taking process, though supposedly with 2 less megapixels. Photos with the T100 are grainy, and last dynamic range in color which is noticible in most photos/prints. I would have to rank it as the least impressive camera that I've owned going back to my first digital camera, a Fuji 2MP i purchased in 2001.. I really wanted to like this camera, but must say I have buyers remorse. I'm still hoping the HD playback will win me over (have yet to try this), but the photo quality and prints that come from this camera really are mediocre at best..

I always had to clip my 2 Gen Shuffle in a spot where I could reach the buttons, oriented in a manner where I knew which end was up and which control was volume versus forward/reverse. Also, since I always clipped it on my pants pocket (that was the most user-freindly location for me in most situations), if I wore a coat, it was always hard to get to the controls.. Well not anymore!. I just love that now I can clip (or not clip) my Shuffle wherever I want and not need to worry about which way it's clipped (facing in, facing out), what direction the controls are facing, and whether I can get to them.

19857,482,"If you own this monitor, go to your control panel, display, settings, advanced, monitor .. then look at your Monitor type. Does it say Plug and Play Monitor? If so (as mine did on a brand new computer), go to properties, driver, and then click on Update Driver. My Monitor type now reads Dell 1907FP(Digital). I noticed the Screen refresh rate dropped from 75 Hertz to 60 Hertz. Not sure what else changed, but I assume this was a good thing to do.. I have a dual monitor setup with these 1907FP's. I can understand the complaint about wobbliness. The stands are well made with great adjustability accomodation, but if the surface they're on is not stable I would think they could be prone to shaking from typing on a keyboard, etc. But then again they are flat screens and designed to take up as little space as possible.. I haven't had these too long and have only experimented with Google Earth beta version that has some significant graphics requirements for operation. Looks fantastic on these monitors.. I suppose many monitors these days have them, but the 4 additional USB ports per monitor is incredibly helpful for me. Cameras and video just plug in right on the desk. Just be sure when you set up your monitors to plug in the USB cable that comes with it as well as the DVI hookup (or VGA). It says to do so in the instructions but the following picture of a completed monitor hookup does not show the cable connected. I left it off and the USB ports didn't work. Ah.... I have a very good graphics card so I'm able to adjust contrast and other nuances so I don't care too much about the on-monitor controls.

15921,748,"Review: 2/15/2010. I can care less about uploading and looking at pictures or listening to music or answering my cell phone thru my GPS, those are time wasting misc features touted as must haves by many review sites these days which seem to review products higher based on their affiliate program payout rates and/or how much they advertise or pay for better reviews. Most of the review sites I've found have Garmin products dominating the best of lists, throwing in another manufacturer?s product now and again trying not to look bias.. I can say this because I've owned Magellan, TomTom, back to Magellan and now was tempted by all the review sites to buy the extreme best Garmin nuvi 765t, DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.. The reviews were misleading and in hind sight mostly opinions formatted in highly appealing graphic charts and visual sites with many pictures.. As a realtor and a real road warrior, What I care about most in a GPS device is accurate, fast directions. I need Multi-destination routing that lets me plan a trip with multiple stops in the order I want, or have the stops automatically sorted by distance &#38; speed with an optimized feature.. I needed to replace my aging Magellan Roadmate 860t after dropping too many times.. After much feature comparisons, performance reviews, hardware and software comparisons using data provided by GPS review sites I was tempted to buy the Garmin Nuvi 765t instead of the Magellan Maestro, a decision I have come to regret.. The Garmin Nuvi 765t has very poor routing engine with little intelligence, often I knew of much faster and direct routes. The Fastest Route feature just keeps you on county roads and highways, main local artery roads were not considered even though they were must faster routes. The Shortest Route feature makes many unnecessary turns, I always thought the shortest route was a straight line, a lesson Garmin needs to learn!. To date the best GPS units I've ever used were by Magellan, even my old Roadmate had more intelligence than this new Garmin Nuvi, just had a slower satellite acquisition chipset.. Even TOMTOM GO 720 performs better as far as routing and selecting a fastest route for me in New Jersey, NYC, PA all the way down to Maryland and Washington DC.. After a month of use and looking stupid after blindly following the routes given, even after tinkering with the navigation options I'm disgusted.. I'm selling this unit and going to buy a Magellan Maestro 4700 or 4370, other options you could consider would be the TomTom XXL 540S, any Garmin junkies are welcome to buy this unit from me, it's spotless and comes with a fantastic aftermarket silicone dash mount. ;-\.",349000,2014-01-09T20:22:08Z

While you don't get advanced features at this price, see if you really need them. There are a few quirks. One in particular is the command to 'merge onto motorway'. That is confusing if there are multiple exits right up ahead. But OTOH, it responds VERY quickly if i deviate slightly from it's route, say to bypass a red light, or if I miss a turn. Nowadays, it is very trendy to have everything widescreen. But it has been pointed out that for a GPS, you need to see what is ahead, not what is to the side.

People say ps3 controllers are dumb because you have to buy a new one when the battery turns really bad but that will happen in like 4years but with 360 your always going to pay 60$ dollars EVERY year. I prefer ps3 exclusives over 360 i mean gears of war and halo are great but mw2 and badcompany2 are just alot better and Left4Dead2 isnt for me i would rather play mw2:).the ps3 has bluray which is replacing the dvd and also ps3 games can be alot more detailed because bluray discs=50ishGB of storage while DVD=9. also with my ps3 has no problems and i have played mw2 for 9hrs straight and no sign of overheating while with 360 you cant play for as long. Also if you want to store ALOT of stuff ps3 is better it supports more formats and the harddrives for it are bigger because you can get any 2.5inch harddrive and install it easily using the instruction manual while 360 is stuck with the biggest size being only 250GB. in my opinion i prefer ps3 controllers because i have small hands and im really used to playstation controllers because I have been with it starting form PS1 but thats just a preference ive also seen a ps3 controller that is the same layout as 360 but its 3rd party so id rather stick with the DS3. And really I have both systems with XBOXlivegold and they are pretty much the same thing with a few differences like trophies and gamerpoints but i use my ps3 more and once my year of gold ends im not buying another year unless microsoft does something big to change my mind.graphic wise same thing except with ps3 exclusives such as god of war 3 look way better than 360 like it looks so realistic i felt as if i was watching a movie.

Bluetooth is awesome! wear wireless headphones all the time at work so I can move around without carrying my MP3 player. When I go snowboarding, I have all the controls on my headset and can place device wherever and not worry about tangles or ear phones snagging out of my ear.. The Sheep on the Island video is comes with is hilarious.. Highly recommend this to anyone. LOVE IT!.",355000,2010-01-04T14:18:08Z

19030,746,"The player is actually quite small for something with a screen this size. I love the simple, clean cut design. The player isnt as wide as the ipod touch so it can be operated using one hand (unless you're trying to get the side buttons). Sound quality is great and the 9-band user EQ is a huge plus. The screen is very crisp too.. Another nice thing is that you can drag&#38;drop files. Although there is a program called Samsung Media Studio, you can use the player perfectly well without it. I only use it to convert videos to SVI format,. The UI needs some getting used to. I thought it was very inaccurate and unresponsive until I fugured out a technique for using it. You have to use the tips of your fingers for more precise input. Now I get much less errors during input, although there still is the occasional mistake.. Overall, this is a great alternative the iPod touch..",357000,2013-05-27T00:47:38Z
6908,319,"I really like the Sansa Clip+ because it's so light you don't know you have it clipped to you. I was surprised by the sound quality is is very good but then I did add my good quality Sony headphones. I didn't need video capacity so this suits me fine. If I'd needed video I would have bought the Sansa Fuze which is similar.. The clip+ doesn't come with complex software, you just use your explorer on your PC to drop and drag files. Files can be deleted directly from the player (not like Ipods which need iTunes to delete files).. The FM radio works well and stations are very easily added. Everything about this little player is so cool - my husband keeps leaving his Ipod Classic at home and stealing my Clip because it's so great to use when you exercise. If you're walking or running there's no added weight so it's not annoying. I think it weighs less than 1 oz. (.9 of an oz from memory). The clip has a special audiobooks section which I use a lot because this is my main reason for purchasing it. When you pause a book and go back to it, you have the option of continuing from where you left off or starting from the beginning.. The clip can have micro sdhc cards added which would be great on long trips so that you could store lots of books ready to read whenever you want, or music for that matter. It also takes slot radio cards which hold about 1000 songs each in a different genre.. The online manual is substantial and very clear. All in all there's not much to dislike about the Sansa Clip+. I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting a tiny, light MP3 player without video..",358000,2012-03-02T20:02:56Z

11204,785,"I bought this camera as an upgrade to my Kodak Easyshare 5 mp camera. I'm not an avid photographer; I just need a camera to take pictures of my kids indoors and outdoors. Right out of the box, I could not get this camera to take a decent picture.. 1) The flash. Either the background ended up much too dark and the subject much too bright, or one half of the picture ended up fine and the other half much too dark. The pictures actually looked better with the flash off.. 2) The clarity. Many of the pictures I took looked grainy. I tried Easy mode, Auto mode, Program mode, changed the ISO, the flash intensity.. you name it, I changed it. Nothing looked good.. The only two negative reviews I've read were written this month, so I don't know if this is a recent defect in the camera? All I know is I am returning this camera for a refund.

I wish the pasenger in my car could give as good directions. (Too use to hearing turn back there) Also found it to be up to date on the newest road in my area.. Only issue is it never quite gets you exactly to the doorstep. I played with it getting directions to places I already know. Found several map errors in small towns.

The unit cannot restore mirroring - period. You have to decide which disk has the right data (and there's no help from the system to do that) and copy everything from it to another disk on your PC. Bzzzzt! My SC101 was only 20% full, and there was no room on my PC's disks for even that..

12944,739,"I second most of the positive reviews here. I actually decided to write this review to clarify a couple things I read in one of the previous reviews.. First, I have been able to receive phone calls even while I have my phone on Hotspot. Because I'm trying to get rid of my home internet (so I can save money), I was a bit concerned about it. I don't get that many phone calls, so I didn't think it was going to be a big deal. One day, though, I was surfing the internet on my computer, using the phone as a hotspot, and the phone rang. Someone mentioned this wasn't possible, and I just wanted to offer another experience.. Second, the speeds on 4G aren't 9MPS where I am. I am constantly speed testing it (using an Android app from speedtest.net), and I consistently get 2MPS and 2.5MPS down. .7-1MPS up. Which is fine. My suspicion is that these speeds are going to get better as time goes on. Yeah, yeah, I know that people say WIMAX is going to clog up its network, and LTE is going to be the more advanced technology. But these are the same things people said about Cable internet, when it was competing against DSL. And, from what I can see, Cable is still fastest.. Third, if you use Google for things (I use it religiously for calendar, gmail, picasa, and maps), you are immediately signed in to your whole internet world. I had all my contacts and phone numbers entered in Google contacts, and I had to enter no phone numbers into my phone. The experience is amazing. It took one sign in, and I was done. I have an iPod touch, and I had to enter my signin for whatever I was using.. Last thing, the battery situation. Yeah, it's kind of annoying. The main plus is that Android lets you customize so much on the phone, and the home screens. I have the switch widgets for all the services on this phone (GPS, 4G, WiFi, 3G, Hot Spot) on my home screen, and when I'm not using them, I make a point of switching them off. One thing to keep in mind, though, when the battery on this phone goes dead, I can buy a new one and replace the old one myself. You have to send an iPhone back to Apple for the same thing. Really, that's not good design.. In the end, this phone can do so many more things than an iPhone (like 4G, customization, multi-notification, etc.), but all the iPhone people can hit it on is the battery life..",371000,2009-02-25T14:05:54Z

6507,943,"We just bought this for baby video and could not be more pleased. With a 16GB SD card (an A-Data purchased on Amazon for under $80) the whole set up came in under $740.00. SD is the way to go. A Blank DVD holds a little over 4GB, a Mini-DVD holds even less. With a built in hard drive if the drive crashes your camcorder is probably toast. SD is fast, small, and a 16GB card will hold a lot of footage without the need for a large amount of quality degrading compression.. I was concerned about image quality in low light. It has not been an issue to shoot indoors with just conventional indoor illumination (lamps, fixtures, florescent etc). The video is crisp and sharp. I am shooting in 24P Cinema Mode. The audio is clear (no tapes means no tape noise artifacts in recording or playback). If you compare this camera with a $3,000 3-CCD, Mini DV system or HD Discovery Channel you will be disappointed. If you comare it to any Mini-DV, HD, or DVD camcorder under $1,000.00 you will be delighted. For the price and size this is a superb great camcorder. Your amateur home video of friends and family has never looked this good before. The only problem is how to share the video once you shoot it..",375000,2013-08-16T02:16:15Z
3918,441,"This is my fourth digital camera. I dropped my Canon Powershot S2 (5MP) and while fixable, it seemed better to buy this Fuji (7MP) at Walmart on closeout (newer Fuji had just come out) for $120. I'm glad I did, while I loved the Canon I liked the Fuji, but at first didn't like it as much. But I've grown to love the Fuji, it works as a point and shoot really well. The 7 megapixel shots are so much better/larger (for cropping) than the Canon. I wrote this review as some of the negative reviews of this camera are due to people who don't read the manual. The camera has a bias toward using it's high ISO instead for blasting the flash. I have a Panasonic that blasts the flash at LOW ISO settings, you get nice pictures of the people, but the background is BLACK (due to the low ISO). With the Fuji you get a slightly grainy picture, but you get the people AND background. Often you cannot tell that the flash even fired from looking at the photo (you can always tell with the Panasonic). I can force the Fuji to do what the Panasonic does in P mode, or manual. But I've come to like the more complete coverage of the Fuji in Auto mode.. For $120 this is an amazing camera, I mainly take pictures of cars at car shows (thousands of them) and the Fuji pictures are AWSOME outside in sunlight. The Auto mode uses a low ISO for smooth pictures of paint jobs (If you use flash it will automaticly go to ISO 800, this makes for grainy pics). So read the manual, and get to understand the camera.. I've shot over 300 pictures in a day and I've never changed the batteries. I fully charge two sets of NiCad's before I go and I've never put in the second set. I even carry a set of Alkilines as Plan C for batteries (as my Canon would use two sets in a day of shooting).. Another feature is the lens cap, Canon owners constantly complain about the cap, the Fuji lens doesn't extend, so the cap fits firmly. Also the lens doesn't move, no opportunities for dust or water to get into the mechanism. So I think this Fuji will last a long time due to this. Also I believe that the Fuji would have survived the fall that killed my Canon, it fell on the extended lens from knee height while shooting a picture of a motorcycle. Afterwards the lens looked like the leaning tower of Piza. The Fuji design MAY have survived that fall, but that is just a guess.. You can still find this camera under $160, so for that money you get an SLR Look and great pictures in Auto mode. I have read the manual so I understand the limitations of the Auto mode. However I seldom used P mode, and haven't really ever used the Manual mode. You can limit how high the ISO goes (Auto 400 mode) however this will darken the pictures, or increase the flash. Since I view the photo's on a computer and rarely print, my trick for 'grainy pictures is make them one half the size, they are still bigger than the computer screen, but when you make them smaller the grainyness is minimized when looking at them full size (Yes I know they are /2 size). They NEVER look grainy on the computer, only when viewing a piece of the picture on the screen, or a really small crop of a large photo. If you shoot outside in the sun you will be amazed the detail. Combined with the optical zoom you'll be amazed.. I seldom use the video, but it seems to work fine. Like my Canon the zoom is useable with the zoom, which is nice. No stereo sound (Canon had it), but at $120 vs. $350 for a Canon S5IS I've gotten along just fine without it. With the $230 I saved I can now go get a Fuji 10 MP camera, and still have the S-700 as a backup. However I am thinking about the Canon SX10 at $399, but that discussion is for another forum..",376000,2008-09-14T07:19:29Z
5762,372,"I must start off by saying that i got this product yesterday and was pleasantly suprised by it! I really wanted to find something better than the iconic iPOD, and i've truly found it!. In the search for my first mp3 player, i was considering three products: 1) iPod nano 2G (2nd gen); 2) Sandisk Sansa e250; and the 3) iRiver Clix.. I investigated all three and here is what i found (and why i picked the Sansa e250). 1) The iPod nano 2nd generation has made many improvements over its last nano. The sound quality is good, the touch wheel is nice, and its simplicity of use is noteworthy. Although the price has come down (2gig for $140), i believe that the iPod is SERIOUSLY lacking in features for that price!! NO fm radio, NO fm recorder (on the fly recording), NO voice recording, NO video (it doesnt support WMA files).. 2) The Sandisk Sansa e250 was at the bottom of my list origninally. However the closer i looked at it the more and more it grew on me!! It offers a TON of features for an AMAZING price ($110)! The features are what sold me over the iPOD. Some people's reviews say they have problems with the e250 locking up. However i have not had a SINGLE problem with this! I was actually told by the worker at the store that they have lots of complaints with the Apple iPOD locking up!!!!!!. The Sansa's sound quality is amazing. I would even say it equals or exceeds the nano's!!! The supplied headphones are suprisingly good too.. What i really wanted was an FM tuner on my mp3 player, and this one even has FM recording. I get tired of the same old songs, so i want the ability to say Hey, im tired of these songs, i just want to listen to the radio for a while!. Another AWESOME feature is the expandable memory with a microSD card, which i also use in my phone, so i can switch them back and forth with music.. The Screen on the Sansa e250 is amazing, big and bright. Photos look awesome. The video feature REALLY suprised me as to how good it was!!!. The spin-wheel is a little bit below that of the ipod (it tends to feel grainy at first, a litle cheap, until you get used to it) but is fine after you get used to it. However the blue ring lights up and looks really sweet!! Some people complain of the buttons being too small, but i have large hands and i have no problem (it's no different from having a small cell phone like so many of us have these days).. The player feels super sturdy in your hand. The back plate is a liquid alloy, so it is very strong and scratch resistant! It is nice and compact, and not much thicker than the overrated Nano.. Downloading music from Windows Media Player was simple, just drag and drop. You have to charge the player with the USB cord, but that seems to be the new thing with mp3 players. And if you think about it, pretty much EVERYWHERE you go there is a computer, so just plug it in to any comp!!!. 3) The iRiver Clix was orignially at the top of my list, althought it was a little more pricey ($180-200). The dock for it looked sweet, and supposedly it is a good brand. However what immediately put it at the bottom of my list after handling it was its design. I NEED to be able to use my player with one hand, since i use mine in the car alot (plugged into the stereo). With the Clix, you pretty much HAVE to use two hands, one to stabilize it and one to push the buttons. The buttons are awkwardly small and placed on the sides of the player. You click on the screen itself to cycle through options, which make the screen one HUGE fingerprint smudge.. That is the one strong point of the Clix. The screen is large (2.2 inches) and very nice. However the ergonomics of the player immediately turned me off to it.. SO ALL IN ALL: The Sansa e250 won out. I highly recommend it for anyone interested! For the price, it was the best value. An amazing product, and yes, i will even go so far to say that it is an iPOD killer in my book. All you pay for with the iPOD is the little apple symbol and the fashion statement some think it entails. I say break away from that trend! Get WAY more features for a better price.. My Roomate just got an Apple iPOD nano 4GB (2nd gen), and i got the Sansa e250 at the same time. Needless to say he is JEALOUS!!. --------------------------------------------------------------------------. Pros: Price, Features (Fm tuner, Pictures, Video, Recording), Screen, easy to sync music with WMP.. Cons: Click wheel feels a little grainy at first, some may say cheap, but you get used to it very quickly!.",377000,2010-12-20T04:50:36Z
3554,444,"THIS IS A TERRIBLE PHONE AND SPRINT WILL NOT ADMIT ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE DEVICE. IF YOU HAVE IT I RECOMMEND RETURNING IT WITHIN THE 30 DAY WARRANTY PERIOD! I am on my third Intercept and still having problems. Phone is very sluggish, drops calls especially when receiving call waiting then phone freezes for 30 seconds or more. Data stops working very frequently and phone has to be rebooted. Sprint denies any problems with the phone. The mistake I made was replacing it with another intercept in my 30 day warranty period. Silly me to think that maybe I got a bad phone, but the next one was bad too. When I went to the Sprint store with my second bad phone they admitted the phone had a software problem, but it was not something they could fix. They sent me a refurbished phone because I was past my 30 days (only by a few days). After receiving the third and now refurbished phone I began having the same issues, I took the third phone into the Sprint store and they did a hard reset and said that should fix the phone. The phone still has issues. The two main problems are dropping calls (especially when a call is coming in) and losing the data throughout the day at which point the phone has to be rebooted. Now the only options Sprint offers involves me spending more money for another phone and extending my contract for two years. I pleaded with Sprint for hours and hours over the phone and through e-mail to help me get the phone replaced. I was not asking for a free phone or for them to replace the phone at no costs. I simply wanted a credit for my phone and to be able to purchase a replacement phone at the contract renewal price. I used my husband's upgrade, so I only have one year left on my contract. They would only allow me to buy a downgraded phone (with no credit on the Intercept) or they said I could pay $105 to buy out my contract and then purchase a phone at the 2-year contract price. After over 10 years as a Sprint customer, I canceled my service. I have never had such a bad experience in my life. Do not buy this phone you will be sorry!.",378000,2012-05-09T13:23:14Z

10761,497,"I'm sending my silver 80gb ipod classic back to Apple and here's why. I'm comparing this to my 3g 60gb ipod. The improvements in the ipod classic come at an unacceptable cost in terms of speed. At first, I thought the touchdial was broken because of its uneven response to my input. Then I realized that the software was just catching up to the sensory input. The nice graphics in the classic are enough of a drain on the dynamic memory that scrolling becomes way laggy. I find myself concentrating really hard to make sure the song I want to select is the one that actually gets selected. Graphics are nice and surprisingly crisp. The lag is surprisingly annoying. They may fix this in an update, but I'm not risking $250 on that. The calibration of the touchdial is really not great either. I find that I have to press and drag for a relatively long time to scroll up just one song.. Oh, and the sound quality out of the earbuds still really really stinks compared to other players out there. The player has millisecond breaks within songs for no reason.

13932,887,I've the PS3 since day 1. The expensive one. It's a hell of a Blu-Ray and DVD player but it sucks at everything else. Still I'd pay $399 for a blu-ray and I'm still hoping for some good games but this IS SUPPOSED to be a game machine. I've only played 1 game since I bought it. Buy an Xbox 360 and let Sony go... maybe if they're desperate enough they'll lower the price even more. Bottom line... If you want a Blu-Ray player buy it. It's a bargain. If you want a hardcore Game Machine buy the Xbox. If you have kids the Wii is a lot of fun and cheaper. I even play my Wii more than this thing. Let's get some games Sony!.,394000,2011-06-08T08:34:09Z

This unit is capable of fitting close to 1TB (little bit less, about 160GB cause it is formatted), in an enclosure that isn't so big.. The upsides of this unit are the capacity, price is not so bad, the enclosure looks nice, it is a quiet hard drive, that does not seem to overheat a whole lot.. There are some downsides to the unit, which is why I gave it four stars. These include that it is a plastic enclosure over aluminum or some material that might keep the drive a bit cooler, there is no fan built in even though there is space for one, and I have not been able to get the back-up button to work. Hitachi could have also added firewire or e-SATA to the drive, but it is ok cause Vist doesn;t seem to like firewire anyways.. The downsides are minimal, as the drive really stays somewhat cool, and the capacity, price, and brand name make it worth buying. It must also be kept in mind that since it is a 1TB hard drive, it may be a bit slow at saving or looking up data, but the speed is actually pretty good..",403000,2009-07-31T07:54:08Z

9926,793,"Windows Vista Home Premium has almost everything an everyday user needs. Networking has been improved greatly, in my experience, which has made connecting wireless a pleasure to actually do, as opposed to a headache. Windows Vista has been changed in the way it behaves and performs certain tasks, it will take a bit of time to get used to how things have been positioned and located but it is very easy to learn. Integrated search has been made available within Explorer windows to ensure that even if you can't find what you're looking for, you can search for any file, feature or option and let Windows return the results.. There are several features such as SuperFetch and the improved search results that will take prolonged use before comments can be accurately made about how well they perform. The sidebar is an interesting idea, one of which I constantly flirt with, wondering whether I should use it or not. At the moment I have my sidebar closed with no gadgets enabled, but this may change over time. Vista provides several gadgets from the moment you install and also allows for the option to download gadgets online that are more tailored to your preference.. I have yet to experience a software, hardware or driver incompatibility. When a program fails to respond or crashes, Microsoft makes an attempt to find out who caused the fault and what solutions are available. If the manufacturer has no available solutions yet, Microsoft will inform you and also let you know if there is a new version of a product and suggest that using the current version may rectify any problems one may be experiencing. My system is fast at start up and shut down, and I have yet to experience poor performance within my system.. Thus far, I am highly impressed with Windows Vista and believe it is actually a decent operating system to take into consideration. However, before you choose to purchase and install Windows Vista on your system, I highly recommend using Microsoft's Windows Vista Upgrade Adviser to ensure that your system, drivers and programs are compatible and meet system requirements. The Upgrade Adviser will also provide you with results that suggest which version of Vista will perform best on your system..",412000,2012-05-17T07:14:58Z

It works great the first five minutes, but after you start sweating....the ear buds WILL fall out. I tried everything.

My Outlook worked best using the web interface my company provides (corporate synch function) and after that it was perfect. My contacts and calendar stay up to date.. The social networking synch is a bit annoying as it melds the twitter and facebook info into your regular contact list. I preferred to remove the twitter info and use the twitter app instead so it did not place all the fools I am following on twitter in my contacts. That is a bit much. It does that with your facebook friends too, and while yes they are friends, they are 'Facebook Friends' and not necessarily folks you want to have to scroll through to call your wife or sister or buddy. Keep them separate.. While I appreciate the 7 customizable screens, it is a bit much. I could do with 5. And one of the most annoying things, somehitng that almost makes me want to send the phone back and cancel my contract, is the irremovable icons on the app listing.

We are still waiting on software allowing the Epic to be able to sync with Outlook without having to go through ten steps every time.

6271,534,"The wife bought me a Magellen 6000t for Christmas. Which is a nice unit but it was too BIG. So i exchanged the unit for the Nuvi 350. I have been using GPS units for 10 years now and i can tell you that Garmin is the BEST GPS you can buy, the 2nd best would have to be Magellen. I own a Magellen and they are great units but Garmin is a better GPS. What about TOM TOM, i am sure they are a great company but Garmin has been around longer and has more expereance then TOM TOM when it comes to GPS's.. Now about the Nuvi 350. I have had it for 4 days now and i have been using it around town. Sure it has taken me a differnt way then i normaly take (one time only) but i didnt buy it for my area. I bought the unit for when i travel. All other times i used the GPS, it has taken me on my normal routes. The 350 does offer two routes, the shorter distance and quickest route. Using one or the other will give you different routes to take so i will have to try them both to see the best option.. One problem i did have is that the 350 did not find an electronic store near my house. It did show the other stores in my area. Since i knew where the store was, it didnt make a difference.. Bottom Line:. If you want a great GPS made by a Company that has been around for years. You should go with the Nuvi 350, 360 or 660. All the bad reviews you read might be true. Those units can be bad or the user doesnt know how to use the GPS. My unit was $499.00 on sale at Target you can buy them cheaper on the Web. For the price i paid, this unit is well worth it. Just remeber, nothing is perfect and every thing has flaws. Try out the unit youself and if you dont like it then send it back and get another brand/unit. Try it your self and you will see.. I will wright an update in 6 months. I am pretty sure i will not have any problems..",434000,2008-08-17T16:15:31Z
4565,397,"I am heading out on a trip to an island, and I wanted a small camcorder that recorded onto a hard drive. My main two priorities were that it have good image quality and that it worked with my mac, running 10.5.6, with Imovie version 7.1.4 .. First, I was afraid of buying this at first, fearing it wouldn't work with my mac. I read reviews that the video was saved in weird formats, that you would have to convert it, whatever. Don't be alarmed, I brought my mac into Bestbuy, plugged in the demo camcorder and imported some video and it worked! Once you connect it to your mac, on the camcorder select PC Connect and then select either your SD card or the hard drive (where ever your video it stored) and import from Imovie. Easy!. Next, I've had it for a day now, and the video image quality it pretty good. I'm sure that there are better camcorders out there, but for paying only $250 (on sale), I'm satisfied.. Also, it does have a night vision mode, which isn't the best. It shows everything at night pretty well, but if you even slightly move the camcorder, there is lots of lag time, so use a tripod and move it slowly.. The battery slides into the bottom of the camcorder, which is very nice. All of the buttons on it are easy to reach with fingers. And it has a built in lens cover, which it nice.. Overall, a great camcorder!.",435000,2009-03-16T16:05:30Z
513,442,"The Mytouch 3G Slide is an interesting phone to say the least. It's basically an upgraded regular Mytouch with a physical keyboard at first glance, but the reality is this phone is much better than previous Mytouch offerings.. My first thought upon turning on the phone was the screen. I'm used to AMOLED screens thanks to my Nexus One, but I was amazed at the brightness, crispness, and overall wonderful color of the screen for the Slide. It only comes in at 3.4, but I never felt as though it was too small. The top coating on the screen gives it a slick surface that's excellent for a touch screen phone.. The other hardware aspects include the physical keyboard which I found a bit lacking. The back-lighting for it is a bit weak and I'm not a fan of the symbols placed directly next to the numbers or letters. This often confused me as to where I was typing and having difficulties finding the symbol I wanted. However, the tactile feel of the physical keyboard was very nice.. The processor on the Slide runs at 600 MHz, but you wouldn't initially believe that as the phone's performance is unbelievably snappy. I rarely seen many instances of slowdown. The most notable occasions occurred when browsing the photo gallery and installing apps from the marketplace. Other than those, most tasks loaded within seconds.. The earpiece for the Slide is very good. I didn't have any problems hearing the conversation. However, the speakerphone is abysmal. Voices and sounds come out garbled. While the ringer is load and clear, using it for phone calls is almost impossible.. Camera is another weak area for the Slide. Photos look grainy and the flash on the camera overexposes images making the subjects look like they were hit by a spotlight. Video for the Slide is decent. Two other issues in the realm of the camera were the phone's realtively small size and physical camera button. The small size often leads to accidently covering the camera lens and microphone. One has to be careful when using it. Also, the camera button is in an awkward position, right against the sliding mechanism, making it difficult, but not impossible to use.. In software, the Slide runs a modified version of Android 2.1, with 2.2 in the near future hopefully. The custom UI is a modified version of Sense that has My Modes, allowing you to customize the look and feel of the phone based on preference. I didn't use it, but it is a nice feature to have. The icons look like they are almost encased in a bubble. This didn't bother me, but some might not like the look of it. T-Mobile has also included a little area in the notifications bar that shows you your most recent applications used. Other than that, most of the usual Sense mods are here including the clock/weather widget, friend stream, and others. If you've never used an Android phone before, these widgets can be customized to show things like Facebook updates, news, contact information, and the like. There are also other widgets that can be downloaded in the widget menu such as a battery widget for determining remaining percentage. Overall, I like the look and feel of Espresso, the name of the custom UI.. One downside is that this phone does not have access to live wallpaper in spite of the fact that it runs 2.1. All other aspects of 2.1 are there as far as I can tell. Still, the official reason was that it wasn't in the custom UI build, but they've never said that the phone can't do live wallpapers to my knowledge.. A few other software related mentions:. Swype is preinstalled and works great. If you get bored with the physical keyboard or just want to try something different, drawing words with Swype is, at times, even faster than normal typing. I enjoy it very much.. The Genius button that's advertised for this phone works quite accurately though it is sluggish to start up. You have to press and hold the button until the screen says that it is listening.. The web browser is great. On an average 3G connection (600 kbps - 800 kbps), pages loaded very fast and text was clean and easy to read. The web browser itself has elements of Sense UI in it like the bookmarks menu with its 3D card flipping effect. All in all, a good experience.. App space is a bit limited though. Hopefully, Froyo will increase the ROM size and let Apps2SD benefit the Slide because I'm already running out of space for my apps. Granted some of them are big, but the big ones even say they can go to the SD card which would save me space.. Battery life is above average. I found I could feasibly make it though 1 day to 1 day and a half which is pretty good for an Android phone. Modifying settings might may it possible for a long time between charges.. Overall, the Mytouch 3G Slide is a good buy for someone that wants to upgrade or someone new to the Android experience. This is no superphone, but its performance and ease of use make it a worthwhile purchase..",436000,2014-05-10T21:13:04Z

10997,324,"Overall, I think the phone is the best phone for sprint. The display is gorgeous, the customization options are plentiful. The only downside to the phone is that it lives on a charger all the time. Now I bought the phone understanding this fact... We all know that these do it all smartphones live on the charger... I don't mind if the phone lives on the charger, what I mind is the location of the charger port... What the hell kind of drugs was Samsung doing when they decided to put the charger port on the top of the phone!?!? How stupid can you be!?!? It's the most awkward when you're charging your phone and you have to talk on it too (very often for this phone). That has to be the worst location for a charging port other than putting it on a corner of the phone. I thought when blackberry put the charging port on the side that was the worst until I met this phone.. Then, to add insult to injury, they put the power button on the side of the phone, where the slider part blocks it a little. That was a complete disaster for Samsung. When the next hot smartphone comes out, that's enough for me to switch from this phone. Other than that, The keyboard is horrible. I never use the physical keyboard because it feels so cheap and big.. too big. Overall the phone is good, but those 2 flaws are like basic things that you need for functionality. I'll keep it for now but will wait to see what the next must have phone will be..",438000,2013-09-14T15:04:24Z

4468,915,"I purchased this because I wanted a portable GPS unit that could slip into a pocket. My priority was to have a simple to use GPS. Everything else was extra fluff, but very nice fluff.. I have a Bluetooth GPS that works with my Notebook and Palm, but it doesn't provide the bird's eye 3D view and the hassle of loading maps and routes is too time consuming for spur of the momment trips.. The Blue Tooth is great for my hands free cellphone, no headset anymore while driving.. Sharing photos was nice, but the viewing angle limited the number people being able to view the photos at the same time.. The best thing is the portability. Which is why I chose this over the c550. I can take this and program my next route, or use it for any of the additional features.. The Screen is bright and looking straight on, it's not a problem, but if you have a passenger assisting or wanting to use, it will be hard to share the view. C550 Screen is much better, not sure why they didn't use the same screen.. Initially, I thought the maps might be outdated as some of the roads appear to not to be there, but zooming in solved this problem.. Likes: No moving parts, all Flash. I like SD format as everything I have is SD (Camera, Palm, etc). I've seen units with Hard Drives. One more thing that could break. Hands Free Blue Tooth Speaker, no more headsets. Like being able to save personal POIs and being able to re-route to them with just a few key strokes. Like being able to make calls to POIs including my personal POIs. The preview route feature is nice if you want to review the route prior to driving.. Dislikes: My biggest complaint is the difficulty removing the unit from the holder which needs to be done in order to retract the antenna if you wish to take with you. My fear is the tourque will at some point crack the case or worse, the screen.. Wish List: Video Support, Better Screen similar to Garmin c550, Built in Traffic Antenna, Built in FM Transmitter, Easier to remove holder, Pouch with a belt clip. Retry times for punching in your security code. Speed control for route preview. Hard cover to protect the screen would be nice. Increase range of motion for the holder (has a small arm with limited movement options).. Overall, great first impressions. Can't wait to try the traffic features, need to get the antenna first..",445000,2014-11-22T03:32:03Z

11436,520,"I like this mp3 player. In fact I like it a lot despite its shortcomings (which are few). What I like most about the Sansa Fuse is its functionality. Everything from transferring audio or media files, recharging, and using the player is simple to do. Unlike the Creative Zen Vision:M which is a great in its own right, its software was just plain annoying and flaky. The Fuse can be used in MTP or MSC. The MSC format allows for drag and drop operation from Windows Explorer, or computers running other OS besides Windows. The only operation that is not drag and drop is the videos, which require conversion using Sandisk's own video converter. While this is an extra step, the software is a breeze to use and painless. It's super quick to convert a 30 Mb video (takes one minute on my old laptop).. Audiophiles and those picking about preserving the original quality of their music will appreciate the FLAC and OGG format support. These are good to have but for the average user, the mp3 format is the way to go. A 4 Mb mp3 file increases to 20 Mb using OGG and 30 Mb using FLAC. Not really practical at the moment given the limited size of the internal flash memory which means you carry less files (however at better quality). I find mp3 encoded at 320 using LAME to be just as good to the ear as those other formats (most of the time). However the player offers expandable memory by adding a Micro SDHC card. Currently the largest is 16 Gb card. In the future more higher capacity cards will be available which future proofs the Fuse so that it won't feel limited in a year or two.. Audiobook listeners will love the Audible (online audiobook retailer) support, as well as the functionalities that make it easy to use. For example there is chapter skipping, resume playback of a book (it memorizes where you left off), and sleep timer. The sleep timer has recently been included in the latest firmware which you can download from the Sandisk website. It allows a sleep timer from 10 to 120 minutes.. There's so much more I like about this player, but not enough room here. Quickly I like to mention the sound quality. That's one of the most important component of any music player. The Sansa Fuse does not disappoint. I've had four mp3 players in the past and this one sounds the best. Yes I've tried Apple Ipods too, and the Fuse just gives a more pleasing sound. I'd describe it as full, wide soundstage, detailed, forward, clear, and bass tight. I use three Sennheiser headphones (Px100, Mx500, HD 595) and a Grado SR60 which are excellent. The Fuse just sounds great with all these headphones. I hear it mentioned before that the Sansa Fuse and Clip are among the best sounding players available, and I am not surprised.. Now for the negatives. I have had this player freeze on me at least once a day. While the fix is easy as holding the power slide for 5 seconds to restart the player, I find it a minor annoyance. With the firmware update, I think it minimized the number of times it freeze especially right after you add files to the player and the player goes through its updating process. The other negative is the screen. Yeah it's small, but what bothers me more is the lower resolution compared with other players like the Ipod and the Zune. It still looks good, but text often have pixelated edges where it should be smooth. The screen is also plastic which makes it easy to scratch. The player should be kept in the velvet cover case which is provided with the player.. Bottom line is this is the best audio player I ever bought. I think it will last me for quite some time, especially with its ability to add more memory in the future. I don't see a reason why one should buy an Ipod over this, especially since feature for feature, price to price, and many other head to head comparisons, the Fuse trumps the Ipod hands down. In fact the Fuse would trump many players on the market. I'd definitely recommend this player for anyone. It exceeded my expectations and so much more..",448000,2014-01-28T06:44:24Z

8964,832,"i really like the camera so far. It's lightweight and and takes awesome footage. the battery it came with has about a 1.5 hours on a full charge (npf-h50). I also got the ACCFH70 kit and that battery has about 3 hours on it. When I got the camera from sony, they had a great deal on the npf-h100...that beast has over 6 hours (with the lcd screen!). the only bad thing i can say about the camera so far is that i am so afraid dropping the camera and breaking it to bits...i know the plastic is light but my canon sd700IS is like a tank compared to the sr11. Anyway, get at least the 2 year service plan from sony...its only an extra $99. what i like about this camera is that it can easily be accessorized. I will be getting married in guam this november, and our honeymoon will be in bohol...i will be getting the waterresistant encasement for this camera and adding another review when we get back!.",463000,2010-10-31T13:34:27Z

Unlike some other drives that will switch off when your PC does this drive stays on until you switch it off. It DOES NOT have a back up button - the button does nothing at all but look nice and the software installed is a joke. Aside from these minor issuees these drives just do not work. I have had 4 of them - all returned to Hitachi and replaced. I bought a 1 TB for piece of mind back-up and instead I got a piece of crap that has got my back up! Terrible - Hitachi should be ashamed of allowing such a half baked unit to be sold with there name on it. Oh - and it's slow too - don;t get suckered in by the CNET review.

The clip+'s small size and almost non-existant weight are perfect for working out. You don't even know it's there. I've had it for a few months now and have had no problems loading music or charging it, etc. My old player used MediaPlayer for syncing, so everything was already set up when I started using this player. Sound is good (even on my cheap headphones) and there are several EQ options. The golist is the ability to add any song to a impromptu playlist that is saved on the player. My Gigabeat had a similar function that I loved, so I was really glad to see that on here as well. The ability to make on-a-whim playlists is excellent. I also plan on buying a 16 gb microsd card, giving me a total size of 20gb. You can't beat that for ~$80.

19788,327,"This set is way underrated. I have had mine for about 30 days after replacing a Hitachi 65XWX20B HD set. I was afraid that I would not like the set because of all the reviews complaining about the black levels. Unless you have a meter you are not going to notice it. The black levels are much better then the set I had and that set was a highly rated set and cost about 4,000.00 at the time. It is newer technology and different type set however the black levels are much better.. The black level is great, the colors are very vibrant and the grays are nice. The thin Basel makes the set look very sleek. It is about 16 inches deep so you can't hank it on the wall, BIG DEAL! It's a big set at a very nice price. Gives you that movie theater felling.. Lots of setting in the advanced menu and there are energy saving modes. This set uses about 218 watts compared to most LCD and plasma set that use 600 watts and up depending on size. For me the energy saving way out way the ability to hang a plasma or LCD on a wall.. Most big theater system use the DLP technology but that has not translated well to the home because you have to replace the bulb and you can't hang it on the wall. Most experts in the industry will tell you that DLP technology will out perform plasmas and LCD sets in color reproduction and clarity.. Anyway I love the set and think it is a great set for the price. On less you have to hang the set on the wall you will love it also..",478000,2012-02-09T06:44:34Z

20487,732,"My experience with the generation2 drobo has been wonderful. The unit is perfect for managing today's endless growth of media storage we all require today. I started out with two 500GB hard drives and just added two more. As I was moving some home movie files to the unit one of the slots started blinking red. That means the disk in that slot has gone bad!! The drobo stopped using that drive and all my data was still available. I returned that drive for a refund and replace it with no data loss. What a great tool! I now have nearly 2TB of capacity and can feel good about the fact that the drobo will protect me from shoddy drives. Nothing short of brilliant.. And performance is great. I did some stop watch comparisons with a single disk iomega firewire drive I was using previously and the drobo is actually faster when reading data from it. About the same when writing. I am also able to do movie editing directly with files on the drobo, so it can work as a primary storage device. Nice!. My only knock is that it would be nice if the drobo management application had an integrated backup capability built in. However, I am using a filesync app I downloaded from the web and it works well with the drobo.. In summary, I find the drobo fast, reliable and the ability to increase (or decrease) your storage pool on the fly is great for managing day to day storage needs.

Even at this screen size, I am able to notice significant improvement in picture quality over a standard progressive scan dvd player.. I cannot comment on the HD sound quality because I am getting standard 5.1 Dolby Digital through my Optical Digital cable to my non-HDMI receiver.. I am disappointed that this player cannot remember multiple disc positions like my previous DVD player which had a independent Position Memory button to remember upto 5 disc positions. This player remember only one disc (standard or Blu Ray) only if you press STOP once. If the tray is opened, the memory is erased.. The player is pretty fast.

Well as soon as I unpacked vx32l I was glad I got the 32 anything larger would gave overwhelmed my medium size bed room.

Prior to the App Store it was mainly a touch screen media player, but with the App Store it turned into a fully functional entertainment &#38; productivity device.. There aren't many downsides but among the most pronounced is the lack of video codec support. Although there are many video converters available, it can be quite time consuming to convert all movies to MP4 format.

The GPS was weak while inside buildings but was fine (although slow) when I had a clear view of the sky. The thing that bothered me the most was the navigation keys at the bottom. They are backlit and the light dims before the screen does and it is very difficult to see where they are. So, I ended up hitting the wrong ones constantly or having to take a couple of stabs at gettng where I wanted to go. It is really a shame that Samsung didn't approach this differently.

This software is really PECE OF ARTE!! Even uninstall didn't fix the problem. Called Sony support - waist of time. They blame everyone but them selfs;. You wouldn't be able to watch recorded videos in Windows media player. It chokes. Sony support says it's Microsoft's problem.. I took this camcorder to Dominican Republic for my vacation trip. It turns out camcorder can't handle too much sun. Dominican sun makes this camera worthless. Picture turns completely white in the areas where sun is reflected.. Camcorder is very small, some times you need to hold it with support by your other hand, and when you do that, I'm sure, you will cover microphones.. I have not found a video-stabilizer there. Doesn't exist.. Night shot feature is another horrible thing available on camcorder. If you want to see vampires - flip the switch. I have never seen anything like this! This option can only be used in horror movies. I can't believe some people find this a Useful feature. Camera 1 MegaPixel. What a joke! Carl Zeis Optics - and useless picture camera.. By the way, if you try to get an upgrade or next version of the ImageMixer for HDD camcorder it's available from Pixella side for 30$. I wander if it's any better than what the camcorder comes with. But I will not try that. I spent enough money on this camcorder. I waisted many hours trying to adopt this work-of-art by Sony and I can't.

Despite what reviewers say, I was diappointed by battery time and have to keep chargers with me at all time. I know you have to keep running apps to a minimum. I guess coming from more basic phones that have minimal battery drain, this was shocking. Charger cord needs to be longer as you will have it on the charger a lot. Make sure you get a screen protector for it as well...the name brand ones from Verizon are quite costly but you can get ones that are made for popular handheld game units, that fit just as well for much cheaper.

However, the price ($199 after rebate) was hard to pass up. The reviews generally seem to favorable.. Even though I had it shipped to my house, it arrived in perfect condition. Set up was exceptionally easy. I have my desktop plugged into the digital port and the laptop docking station plugged into the analog port and easily switch between the two with the 1/2 buttons up front. Have not experienced a single dead pixel so far and have not noticed a significant amount of light bleeding. The widescreen aspect is really great for webpages and movies. ViewSonic definitely lives up to its reputation on display quality.. The only trivial dislikes are the cheap looking buttons and the limited range stand, but for the price, I can live with those shortcomings..",513000,2011-03-19T00:43:46Z

6315,933,"In short, I am happy with it so far, it's cheaper than the SD870 I bought for my mom and after some time learning all the features from the online manual and some trial and errors, I think I can take better pictures with it. I have been using Canon Powershot for the past years (S300, SD300, SD800) and would like to get something that can take better indoor pictures / videos in weddings and performances. I was looking for compact mega-zoom with decent low light performance and came across the HX5v. (Tough choice between the sony and Canon S210, didn't pick S210 because of it's zoom button and slower speed). Anyway, I got it in time for my kid's dance recital and both video and images, once know which mode to use, has been meeting my expectation. The pictures are somewhat on the soft side for the most part but I think that beats having excessive noise. There are more controls and different ways to capture images than my old canon's and I am actually enjoying exploring how I can get better pictures with this thingy. It's no DSLR but I want something that's more portable and it's a nice upgrade for myself and my family for capturing the precious moments in the next few years to come..

I was tired of the lack of support in the 64bit os so I installed the 32bit version of Vista (64bit copy is free if you purchase Vista) so I could avoid all the problems and hopefully start using things like my iPod again (Apple never released 64bit drivers). The installation took a bit more effort than I thought it would (in part because of the 64 to 32bit change but also due to having to restructure my hard drives.

19163,742,"This GPS is great for someone who wants to enter into the world of GPS. I've had GPS systems in the past, but they've usually been hand-helds with no built-in maps. This one has very detailed maps of the US, Canada and Guam and has a very sleek form factor.. The time it takes to find satellites is almost non-existent. It'll lock on to a signal in 30 seconds or less, in most cases! This thing also has a dynamite screen. It's bright, crisp and colorful. The touch capability of the screen can sometimes be a little fussy, however, but that's probably because of my big fingers. Just use your fingernails or a stylus if it ever becomes a problem.. Accuracy is also awesome, and the customizable navigation voices that are available are really cool for those who want something out of the ordinary. I downloaded John Cleese's voice and found it very funny.. There haven't been too many problems I've had with this GPS, except a few minor things. First, the included windshield mount is very strong. You may that's a good thing, but just wait until you try to take your TomTom out of it! It's takes a lot of effort to get it out, and you'll probably end up having it pop out and fly across the car if you're not careful. Also, on two occasions, the TomTom has frozen up on the boot screen. I have no explanation as to why this happens, but it's easily fixed by pushing the reset button with a paper clip or thin pencil.. Overall. The TomTom one is an incredible GPS for GPS noobs or experts. It's fun, small, accurate, and, in most cases, reliable..",519000,2011-10-12T04:45:07Z

Now, half a year after the warranty expired the top half of the display goes bad. Apple will not allow anyone else to do the repair which runs into the hundreds to have Apple do it. A good monitor should last a little longer than that, especially since it costs a small fortune. What a disappointment in Apple. They used to be a company with heart. No more it seems.

7068,528,"After two weeks of use compared it with Hero (tested one week). The dust accumulation on the Hero screen was a deal breaker for me. The screen in sharper than the Hero but I would expect better battery life given the AMOLED screen, although battery life on the Hero was just as bad. Glad to have the keyboard because my flat-tip fingers were just bad for vertical virtual keyboard, horizontal was a bit better but takes getting used to it. Reception issues inside home was resolved by Retentions Dept at Sprint providing me a free Airave with no monthly fee, at home I use Wi-Fi. Call quality is very good, loud and clear, speakerphone much better than Hero. Picture quality is good but the shutter button is extremely slow, image stabilization feature would be nice. Although Hero has 5MP camera the Moment's pics looked better. User interface in Hero is much nicer but I have learned to customize Moment's screens and I came to conclusion that I can have everything I really use in 3 screens. Most of these new smartphones do very poorly in terms of battery life and both HTC Hero and Samsung Moment add to this list. The Moment has some glitches in power management that are a bit annoying and here are examples. After reading reviews I went through 3-4 cycles of fully charging/discharging phone and not much difference was noticed because battery indicator is crazy estimating battery life. After a few hours of normal use (4-5 hrs) the battery meter suddenly drops to indicate 15% and screen in dimmed. It remains at 15% for the next 3-4 hrs before going into red indicating less than 15%. At this point you can't use certain energy hungry devices such as camera/camcorder. In another instance I was charging phone through USB cable and when I took it off it kept indicating that it was charging. Problem was that phone was not managing energy use at this point and towards the end of the day it just indicated battery low, phone shutdown and I was left without communication at that point. Hopefully these glitches will be resolved in the next software update (Please!!!). So why in the world would I keep this phone? Well honestly Sprint has been very supportive (unbelievable right?), have addressed all my main concerns of home reception (out of home phone works great), Sprint TV keeps kids (and adults) entertained, Sprint Navigation is excellent, watched NFL network game last Thu (an otherwise $10 add-on to my cable bill) and the Android platform is awesome, so I only had to choose between Hero and Moment. Although I use phone with one hand, I found the keyboard easier to use than virtual one, although the Hero virtual keyboard was a bit better than the Moment's. The Moment is faster than the Hero (much less lag), the AMOLED screen is far better than the Hero LCD, especially viewing angle (when both kids want to see Spongebob on Sprint TV...impossible in the Hero). But the choice was clear when I confirmed the fact that the Hero does tend to accumulate dust on the corners INSIDE the screen...Hero needs very special care to prevent this. I got used to the bulkier phone type (stepping up from a Centro) although I still try to reach for a stylus at times (hardest habit to break). Just wish these phones would either allow install of apps into SD card or have larger memory space to install these. Overall I like the Moment on Sprint's network.",526000,2010-11-12T17:20:08Z

14630,470,"I first saw this camera at the NAB show in Las Vegas in April 2004. It's a remarkable feat that this camera is still available on the Sony product catalog--like the HP 12C calculator, it's still around because it does so many things so well.. Back then, it was pretty much the only game in town. It was the first practical, high quality, relatively inexpensive HDV product from any manufacturer. Now, you have over a dozen HDV choices, and new DVD-based and memory-based HD options have been introduced. Even so, the FX1 is beloved by many.. The case is magnesium and it's built like a tank. A relatively bulky tank. Still, there's lots of real estate for the numerous manual controls that pros and semipros demand.. The Achilles Heel of HDV is tape dropouts. On DV a dropout is a tiny pixel glitch; on HDV it's a 1/2-second blackout (video and audio). Use decent HDV tape, which sells for maybe $10 on the Internet.. When compared to a few of the latest cameras, the FX1 doesn't have XLR audio connectors, so if you insist on only those connections you'll need a $100 adapter box. Stereo miniplug gives the same quality for me, and it's much more compact. The connector is more delicate, however.. All in all, a great camera. One downside: it looks TOO professional in some circumstances. Last summer I was barred entry to the Louvre in Paris because of this camera. Something to do with professional licensing rights or whatever. Wish I'd had my little Sony HC-3 HDV camera with me back then..",528000,2011-07-17T14:11:48Z

Of course the screen is excellent. Pictures and videos look beautiful on this but it's sad that videos couldn't be watched too much.. I liked that they added games into the menu. I used to have to manually add the games feature but now it even comes with two games. I found myself killing the battery with this, too.. The thing I really liked was the clock since I used to have to use game applications as a clock. For me, the clock used to be the real setback.. Honestly, I will say that not much changed with the Zune software. It still looks pretty and I love it. It just shows your account in the right hand corner and I believe there are some other minor changes but I didn't really pay attention to that. ^^.

So I CALLED sandisk tech support (18667263475) and they walked me through going into recovery mode and reflashing it and its worked perfect ever since (about 10 minutes now).,551000,2008-07-24T20:31:27Z

5686,898,"I purchased this player about a month ago when Amazon was running the 4 Blu-ray's and a Samsung player for a big discount. Picture quality and audio are great, when they work. I've had problems on several discs with audio lag and when the player found a firmware update over the network, I readily upgrading to it only to have the upgrade process kill the player. I've heard updating from USB does not have any issues.. Even though I was a few days past my 30 day return, Amazon was gracious enough to overnight me a new player, same model. I cant say enough about Amazon's customer service, they are superb. I got the new player in and upgraded the firmware with a USB thumb drive this time and was successful, however the player continues to have a delay in the audio. Just to be sure I connected the player to a TV using just a brand new 1.3b HDMI cable and bypassing my receiver, the audio delay continues. I hear no audio lag playing regular DVD's by the way.. Out of curiosity, in case it might be the discs themselves, I purchased a Panasonic Blu-ray player from Best Buy. Absolutely no audio lag, works perfect. Although the operational speed of the Panasonic player is not as fast as the Samsung, I'd rather have audio the way it's supposed to be heard instead of watching a movie that looks like it's been dubbed over.. I don't know if this is a problem on all of these players or maybe a run of them came out bad, but I've had two bad so far and I'm about done with this model. The model up from this one has the same video processor so it might have the same issues. I'll give the player high marks for it's operational speed and slick interface, but the audio problems are a deal breaker for me. I would look elsewhere if I were you.. I just received a full refund from Amazon on the second player but will probably just wait until an affordable player is released that operates fast and has no issues..",566000,2014-04-23T19:00:56Z

5134,515,"This is an exceptionally well-designed, easy to use GPS with an awesome user interface that makes entering locations a breeze. I love that the color scheme can automatically change depending on the lighting conditions and I love the text to speech, meaning that it can speak street names. I have used it on several trips and It does a great job letting you know that turns are coming up and which specific exit to take etc, especially on difficult interchanges where you might not be clear on where to turn. The only feature I wish it included was advanced lane guidance, as that seems like a really useful extra but the 255W does a great job without it anyway. There are several ways to enter a destination which is also a plus. You can choose a POI which are broken down really cleverly into sub-menus and sorted by distance which means that I can enter just about any place I want to go with just a few taps of the screen, and you can search by place name as well if you don't know the address or anything else. Generally, it is very predictive and does a great job at guessing where you're trying to make it go so that you don't have to enter in every letter of the place, a big time saver. You can avoid certain streets if you want and do many other things, but basically it comes with just about all of the extras you could possibly want. It is extremely fast with route calculations and recalculations if you miss a turn, and there is practically no wait time. Overall, this is a great GPS and I did a lot of looking around before I bought it. I managed to get a really good deal on it as well, so it was a no brainer when I decided to buy it. If you are unsure whether to go for it or not, the best advice I can give you is to go for it unless you want lane assist and 3D building view, which really are over-hyped features anyway and are generally only found on much more expensive units.

But think twice before about any good deals you find on this because it doesn't include and external charger, battery has to be charged in camera which is incredibly slow and inconvenient. Luckily they do make an external charger which is faster, but it is expensive.!.

Not sure what canon was thinking with the battery design on this camera, but it clearly falls short. Doesn't last long (60 minutes if you are lucky), and then charging is incredibly slow and inconvenient in-camera. I can understand a battery being an accessory, but the external charged should be included.

The picture quality is amazing, but i dont have much to compare it to as this is my first HDTV, but i can see how cnet says it is amazing cause side by side at bestbuy their is no comparison.. The main selling point for me that i found in this TV was the price, at about $2500 canadian MSRP (you can find it for like $2200 if you look around) it is a steal. I honestly cant get over how some TV's still get away with a huge markup for canada (cough westinghouse cough), so if your canadian this is definaly a TV to be considering..",599000,2008-04-24T14:06:23Z

16103,875,"I upgraded from my Sony Hi8 to the Sony DCR-DVD403 on 01 April '05 for $750 + s&#38;h. I have been doing a lot of research on the different DVD models available in the market. 403 is the latest of all. Here are some Pros.. 1. Has 3 CCD which means true-to-life color.. 2. The 3 MP picture mode also delivers good pictures. (Though I have a 5 MP digicam, its still handy to know that 403 can take good quality digi pics). 3. The best of all that I like is the way you navigate through the recorded scenes. No more REW and FF's and no more accidental over writing.. 4. Each recording session is stored as individual tracks. What this means is that you have smaller files to edit and manipulate. Which means less time consuming while editing.. 5. The touch screen is another feature that I like. No messy buttons on the body like other models.. 6. Watching video in wide screen looks good. Its compatible with normal TVs as well.. 7. The line-in recording is super. I can convert any movie to a DVD.. 8. It operates good in low light.. Now lets come to some cons.. 1. The view finder, is always straight. I would have appreciated if it can be tilted up and down like other Sony Camcorders.. 2. Mini DVD media is expensive. I work around this by having a few DVD-RWs.. 3. The provided software, Picture Package, is a YUK. I never like it. You can use PP to only burn a MiniDVD on your camcorder. It cannot burn on my external DVD burner. Why would you wan to burn a MiniDVD? But one good thing about that is that the sound can be converted from 5.1 CH dolby to the normal 2 layer stereo. If you ask me why you want to do that, the answer is, if you want to use the MPEG with 5.1 CH Dolby on your other video editing s/w's like Photo Studio etc., you will not hear the sound. You need to convert the audio before using other s/w. I currently use PIXELA Image Mixer (This is provided for other older Sony DVD models) and its able to recodnize the 5.1 CH sound. DVD encoding is also excellent in that software. If you can get a copy of that, then you need not use Picture Package at all.. Overall, The best DVD camcorder in market..",604000,2014-06-09T07:06:46Z

The model currently shipping is a first version and has major issues. Just check the Dell Support Forums...customers with this monitor are eagerly awaiting a new hardware revision!!!. First, the wide color gamut is basically incompatible with Internet Explorer! (and any other non-color managed applications!) Most images on the web and in most other applications use the standard sRGB color profile. This monitor does a poor job in displaying these images. Users are having to use special color-managed web browsers for this monitor!. Second, this monitor has been found to have the worst input lag of just about any LCD! Gamers be warned...this monitor is NOT for you! The input lag is so bad it's even noticeable in scrolling on web pages!. Dell is promising an updated revision that should fix the input lag and other issues. Not sure how they will address the color gamut issue if even at all.

4845,375,"Don't do it! Terrible! Worst camera I have ever owned and NO it's not due to operating error. I'm an amateur photographer and have many years experience with various cameras including the oh-so-simple point and shoots. Nikon screwed up on this one. And, yes I've read the manual inside and out, I've even taken it in to get looked at, it's just a badly made camera. The shutter is absolutely terrible. You have to hold the shutter button half way, wait for it to focus and beep, which can literally take up to 10 seconds! 10 seconds, really Nikon?? Then, take the picture after it has focused. I know it's not an SLR, but Nikon could have done much better with this point and shoot. And, it doesn't change depending on the mode you're in. So, if you have kids, or want to take ANY moving/quick snap picture, DON'T do this camera. You'll regret it. Get one with a much faster shutter. Also, the picture quality is blurry and the color can be yellow. This happens no matter the setting (outside/inside, flash/no flash, whatever mode you're in, and after waiting for it to focus for those disturbing 10 seconds).

The GPS is unusable, as it will never pinpoint your location any better than a thousand meters, and one of our phones at the store actually says we are in New Jersey no matter where we are.

4022,464,"I work in sales, and my car is my office. I was in the market for a Navigation system that needed to have a friendly interface, along with Bluetooth and MP3 Functionality. After spending months of research both on and off line, it was easy to conclude the NUVI 360 was the best of breed.. It essentially came down between the NUVI 360 and the Tom Tom GO 910. I had the opportunity to experiment in person with both units, and the 360's interface was simply tighter, the calculations seemed faster, and touch screen was more responsive.. I've only had the NUVI for a little over two weeks, and I could not be more satisfied. I should note that I had the unit professional hard-wired into my car's CD Changer input using the NUVI's 3.5 mm headphone jack. This allows the sound to come through my speakers, and all I can say is AWESOME!. I also have the flexibility to connect my 30GB MP3 player, but with the NUVI 360's MP3 capabilities there's really no need. The interface is just so damn friendly while driving (much easier to read and select through the tracks).. The BlueTooth functionality is hands-down my favorite feature. Ordering take-out on the way home from work has never been easier (or more fun). Simply tap food to locate restaurants within your area, then tap the phone number displayed with your desired listing and the call is made. No longer any need for 411.. My Motorola Q had no problems connecting to the 360, and all my contacts (hundreds) were easily downloaded into the NUVI's phone book making dialing calls a breeze (also makes for a great caller ID). People are amazed when I tell them I'm calling from the NUVI because of the call's clarity (it may help that the unit is mounted to the side of the center consel).. Most importantly is the navigation itself. Great graphics, very responsive touch screen, quick calculations, and excellent info/stats (including estamted arrival time, speedometer, compass, total drive time, ability to add stops to final destination, etc).. Overall, I am very much MORE than satisfied with the NUVI 360. I wouldn't recommend anything else for the money (now around $400 on most online retailers).

Please wait for a Samsung Agent to respond.. You are now chatting with 'Vail K'. Vail K: Hello, I am a Samsung Technical Support representative. How may I assist you today?. Visitor: i have a bd/p 1600 blue ray player and trying to play ong bak 2 dvd, but it won't play.... Visitor: i read a few forums stating that samsung is waiting for a new firmware to come out so that this movie can be played...but no eta on when newer firmware will be out, is this correct?. Vail K: Is it happening with all the discs?. Visitor: no, not all discs, all other discs work great.... Visitor: just this one dvd, hence why i checked forums and seems that there may be other people who also experienced this and contacted samsung about it too.... Vail K: IS it the DVD disc or the blu-ray disc you are unable to play in the player?. Visitor: this ong bak 2 plays great on my sony blueray player but not my samsung.... Visitor: all my discs are bluray. Visitor: my firmware i have currently is BEV.2.08_100319A_XAA. Vail K: Alright. Did you try with the another disc of the same title ONG BAK?. Visitor: I don't have duplicate disks of ong bak and i don't have the first version.... Visitor: i have 3 other samsung players all the same mdel for my home, and all have latest firmware and all can't play it.....but my sony can play it correctly. Vail K: RESET the player and try to play the disc again and let me know the outcome.. Visitor: ok, i can certainly do this one more time, but just so you know, i have done this SEVERAL times already on ALL of my samsung blurays.... Visitor: hold please while i do it YET once again.... Vail K: Sure, To reset your BD Player, with the power on and with no disc in the player, press and hold the FF button on the front panel for five seconds. The language screen will appear and all settings will revert back to factory settings.. Visitor: the forum i read about this issue with this dvd player said samsung had them do this as well, i tried this as well on my own already but still same issue...only thing this does is having me to to reconnect all my subscriptions.... Visitor: is there someone there you can ask about this issue with this 1 dvd?. Visitor: ok done.... Visitor: is it a firmware issue?. Vail K: I can understand your concern, the issue might be due to the compatibility of the disc. We will forward this to our support department and they will update the firmware to resolve the issue.. Visitor: should i put dvd back in? last time i did this it didn't work .... Vail K: Yes, please put the disc and play it again.. Visitor: already did and still can't play. Visitor: i am putting another dvd in now and that is one is playing. Visitor: so compatibility of the disc = samsung needs to come up with another updated firmware to be able to play this disc right?. Vail K: Yes, that is right. We will forward this title to the support department. They will add this title to the queue and release the firmware.. Visitor: is there a list of dvds that can't be played by samsung blurays you can provide me?. Visitor: i don't want to buy more that fall on this list just to be disappointed yet again..... Visitor: i wish i would have known this was going to be an issue since at this point its more trouble than its worth and would have not purchased samsung bluray player at all..... Vail K: I am sorry, we do not have the information about the other titles. At present, only 2012 is the title which have this problem, we forwarded that to our support team.. Visitor: so no ETA on when firmware will be updated to be able to play this on my samsung player than?. Vail K: The firmware update may release in the month of april or may. We do not have the exact information about the date.. Visitor: actually, i have 2012 and just put it in again and it does work there is no issue in watching this disc.... Vail K: Yes, only some players have the issue playing the 2012. Your player may play this disc.. Visitor: can you tell me what the policy to return these samsung bluray players that i purchased...? at this point, i would rather return it since i consider these bluray players useless if i have to wait another 1-2 months to be able to watch a dvd i buy.... Visitor: ironic that i have 4 total samsung players and none of them play my ong bak 2 disc..... Visitor: but they all play my 2012 disc. Vail K: I apologize for the inconvenience. Samsung do not sell the products directly to the customers, it is only done by the retailers or the dealers. The return policy depends on the store you purchase.

19260,913,"I've had 3 phones in the last 8 weeks in sequential order the phone 4, Captivate, now the Droid 2. I first upgraded to the iPhone 4 since I had the 3gs and liked it, but then I decided to try something new and switched to the Captivate to try Android.. Once switching to Android, I definitely came to appreciate the simplicity and user friendliness of the iPhone. On the other hand, I had a lot of fun setting up the Captivate too - custom backgrounds, getting my home screen up, putting Launcher pro on (beats the Samsung UI as it beats most), widget locker, putting on videos of any format (use Rockplayer). Let's just say, it took me many many hours. At this point, I noticed my phone was slowing down. Noticeable but not horrible.. I annoyed my bf with complaints but shrugged off the slowdown. Then I put my exchange email on and it became even slower. Then after a couple days, when my exchange stopped syncing, I did some research and realized that my work securities settings wasn't compatible with Android 2.1 and the native exchange app. I then proceeded to try Touchdown which my co-worker loves and would have solved the exchange issue. Getting pass the 80's looking UI of Touchdown, it had a lot of advantages, however there was a hitch. It took 4 hours to download my emails at set-up, minimum of 30 seconds to open an email or do anything that involves switching screens. So basically it didn't work. After more research, I found that Touchdown knows about the issue. They think it's caused by the fact that for some reason the internal memory is an SD card which was my guess as well.. After all that, I decided I liked the flexibility and additional functionality of Android though it involved more work than the iPhone, but could not live with how slow the Captivate became or my Exchange email issue. Therefore, I've moved on to the Droid 2. That's another review..",628000,2013-04-09T21:32:22Z

4107,994,"This is my first Android phone. I was holding out to see what Microsoft was going to come out with, but after trying a iPhone and an EVO at Best Buy, I knew I wanted an Android phone. The Droid X was perfect. The screen looks amazing. It's not a retina display, but good luck tying to spot individual pixels on this thing. Even at 4.3 inches everything looks detailed and smooth. Even zoomed way out on websites with the fonts really tiny you can still read the site if your eyes are good enough to see text that small. The display can easily be seen in direct sunlight after it adjusts to in which takes about 1-2 seconds after exposure to sunlight. I cant believe how fast this thing is. I found the experiance to be faster and smoother then the iPhone 4 I tested, and when Android 2.2 comes in in a few weeks it is going to be 5 times faster which is actually hard to believe that it could be any faster. The notifications feature is very good. A quick swipe down from the top of the screen will show you notifications such as emails, text messages, app downloads, system updates, and many other things. It also has an indicator light that will flash green when you have new messages waiting and your phone is in sleep mode. It also makes a very good flashlight in a pinch with the dual leds on it. The market has plenty of offerings for people wanting to pick up additional games and applications, but make no mistake, the phone has a great array of applications built in and waiting upon turning it on for the first time. I find myself picking up this phone when I would have picked up my laptop in the past because it is so fast and easy to perform different functions on the 4.3 inch screen. If you want function over form in a package that still looks amazing, this is the phone for you. It is a work horse that can get the job done while still looking great..",633000,2012-08-07T16:00:30Z

As for the fact that its only 6 megapixels: Ive taken great photos with a lot less. Print quality is a factor of matching the resolution of the printer to the image. In any event, I would recommend it to anyone..",634000,2008-11-02T01:18:06Z

15798,832,"Sorry CNET, you missed the target on your review. I am an audio technician/sound engineer, so I hope my opinion helps those looking for the most bang for the buck.. First off, through the included headphones out the window, they are worthless. Not uncommon in this price range. Grab a decent pair right from the start. I recomnemd JVC HA-FX33. The have soft foam rubber inserts that fit and stay put. The sound competes with Bose earbuds, which I have in my studio, and cost more than they were worth.. The features of this little player are fantastic. YES, it does support album art. Seems many reviewers don't realize this for some strange reason. The EQ has presets, but better yet, it has a custom setting for getting the sound just right. Perfect for serious listeners.. Playlist support, listing by groups, such as artist, song, etc, make it simple to use. The screen is plenty bright and easy to read. Let's face it, screens this small are not good for viewing photos, I don't care what brand you buy. What it is good for, is easy to read menus and album art.. The FM radio works well, and has presets. It records from the radio if desired. The built in mike records voice. The built in rechargable battery charges when it is connectred to a USB port. Works for 15 hours on a single charge. There is an external memory card slot for mini SD cards.. I love this little player, and use it often. I own a music studio with over 200,000 dollars of audio equipment, and I chose this little player for personal iistening, after trying about 20 different players, from the cheapest to the most expensive. This is my recommended player.. Mike Shillow. Bigmike Studios. Lincoln, NE.",638000,2013-12-19T01:49:00Z
20068,988,"I think this TV has the best picture I have ever seen.It was not easy to find and I probably paid too much for it. No regrets. I did not have it calibrated. I saw Quantum of Solace on it in the store and the details are stunning. The blacks are truly amazing. I have a Sony LCD 46 and I thought the image was great and actually did not think it could get much better. I saw the Planet Earth Bluray on the Sony and thought it was spectacular but on the Pioneer it was even better. I have seen the Casino Royale Bluray many times but even that movie on the Pioneer allowed me to see details not seen before. The contrasting shades of black and dark gray is where it shines. For casual watching it is best with sports in my opinion. I watched the World Series on hi def cable which I believe is 720p and it looked great and natural which in my opinion was the problem with LCDs. I think the LCD is cheaper but my perception is that movies and TV look like soap operas that is, kind of artificial looking. Just a personal preference. I was a little gunshy given that Pioneer is exiting the TV business but part should be available for 7 years. That may be BS but I took the plunge. I don't regret it . Linked to a good home theater I think you can rest easy that you hav e the best picture possible outside of some very high end systems. No problem with screen burn in although I worry when my nephews will use it for gaming on the PS3! Even my wife who is your typical woman with regards to electronics thinks the picture is spectacular! Did not need to go to the doghouse for this one.

You can turn all the auto stuff off and then upload to the IPod manually. A huge flaw that I found was that you can upload the same song multiple times which is very annoying if you don't already know it's on the IPod. As for the IPod itself I'm satisfied. Good interface that is easy to navigate. I wish I could erase songs without being hooked up to my computer. Earbuds can be thrown away upon opening the box. They're pretty cheap. I have a pair of Shure SE530's on order that I have high hopes will solve this problem. My Sennheiser muff headphones do sound great on the IPod, however. Overall, I went for the IPod Classic bacause of the enormous memory for the money. I was really considering a Creative Labs Zen, but could not get it into my budget.

2753,318,"After owning the TT 720 for over a year my buying recommendation is a resounding no. If you are buying it for the added features like map share upgrades you will be disappointed. I have yet to receive one loop, lane, court or street upgrade from this function even though I have downloaded upgrade to my unit many times. Map share does not add one iota upgrade of anything. If you have decided to buy any of TT?s unit for the RDS-TMC feature be advised it?s going to cost you $60.00 yearly to subscribe for this service, but before you can use the service you must purchase the antenna plug receiver for over $130. I?ll sell you mine for only $90. The navigation part of the unit itself is questionable, I?ll have to give it a B+. The unit redirects your route if you miss it, but remember it?s an electronic device that?s as good as its programmers. I?ve had instances where I?ve missed a turn, and instead of redirecting to make a u-turn when possible it took me around the block of neighborhoods, other times more times than I care to remember the unit because of the lapse in receiving the satellite signal told me to make a turn when it should not. If you are buying it for its mp3 capabilities please be advised that if you use it wirelessly the signal is very poor and most of the time the signal is in and out making listening to music this way completely insane.. My recommendation to you is to get a unit that was manufactured within the past 6 -9 month and pay as little as possible and discard it and buy a new one when you need to..

I initially planned on buying the TomTom One LE, but after a quick chat with the salesman I was drawn to the Garmin which, he said, is a better unit and worth the $50 increase in price.. I live in the East Bay of the SF Bay Area, and decided to test it out on a day trip to SF. Going there I had no problems, with the exception of after coming out of the Caldecott Tunnel (because it lost signal), it recalculated my location as the side street next to the freeway and therefore popped up with all these directions to get to the on-ramp. After driving a few minutes it realized where I was and correctly calculated the route.. While in the city, I tried out the pedestrian mode, and was greatly disappointed. It couldn't figure out where I was (but was in the right vicinity) and as I walked in the Richmond district it didn't correctly move the way I was moving. Perhaps because a pedestrian moves considerably slower than a car? I don't know. But I really won't use it for walking around.. Driving home was the worst. While I drove on the freeway, it kept telling me I was on the adjacent streets, and also estimated my time of arrival as 11 hours later. At this point I told myself I was going to return the unit because 1) mine is defective or 2) the unit's dumb. However I was the dumb one because I realized I still had it on pedestrian mode.

13196,784,"I actually have one of the 32GB ones. In the month and a half I've used it, it has met or exceeded all expectations.. It is literally the size of a credit card and only 0.44 thick.. I also use it with the Creative Hard Case, which adds thickness, but it's still very pocketable, and the integrated kickstand is a plus. From an angle, there is a rainbow sheen on the case, but from straight on, it's very clear. There is no protection for the buttons on the clear case, so I used a clear screen protector film to protect them. The case is a tight fit, and the film will make it harder to get the case closed, so don't use too much film. I don't use the carabiner that comes with the hard case, because it's kinda weak, and on the NYC subway, someone's liable to literally rip it off of you.. I use MediaMonkey to sync, which by itself is brilliant. MediaMonkey Gold will re-encode and sync on the fly. I use WMA's on the device to save space (8000+ songs, 2 full length movies, 5GB to spare. , and the quality is good enough for the morning commute.. SD card integration is slowly improving with the firmware updates, but is still largely separate. I'm not too concerned because I plan on using the main memory for music, and the SD card for video.. Sound quality, even with the WMA's, is outstanding. I'm using Skullcandy Ink'd Noise Isolating earbuds (cheap and sufficient until my Etymotic's arrive), and on a busy subway, I rarely raise the volume above 10. There is also an EQ for tailoring the sound to your taste.. Video must be re-encoded to play on the device. Yes, it will play Divx. I use iRiverter, with the Zen Vision:M setting. The included conversion software will work, but it only converts to wmv, it's slow as a dog (intel E4300, 1gb ram), and the end result on the player is not as good as what is produced with iRiverter.. If you get this player, if you want to preserve battery life, the hold button becomes your best friend. AFAIK, using the hold button ensures the screen is off while playing if you don't need it, and is the only way to ensure the player is completely off and not in standby mode when you turn it off.. It's annoying, but you get used to it quickly, and it turns into a non-issue.. FM radio works well (when I use it), I don't use the Organizer (got a BB 8320 for that), and I also haven't tried the Microphone....but I may try that to record a meeting later.... I have yet to try it with Linux, but I'm sure that community will adapt soon.. I have yet to experience the WSOD that I see people complaining of in the forums. Not with the original firmware that came with the player (1.13.01) and not with the upgraded firmware (1.20.02). Overall, I'm very happy with the Creative Zen, and recommend it with no reservations for someone who doesn't mind getting thier hands a bit dirty.

15965,923,"Out of the box, this media player is a little clunky and flawed, but if you update to the latest firmware from WD, 98% of the issues are fixed. If you are like me and have to have support for something the factory firmware doesn't support, you can void the warranty and install a custom firmware, and allowed me to use my ext2/ext3 formatted external hard drives. It's quite simple and very safe. There has been very few video formats that I have not been able to play, and my favorite being MKV, is supported (for anime, I know, I'm a loser). You truly can't go wrong with this, unless you HAVE to go with a proprietary standard, such as WMV, which this little guy will always say no to, and could be a problem that some people here are having problems with but aren't reading the manual. As far as audio, I don't do much listening through my WDTV, since I like to listen to it on the go, but it does play many formats flawlessly, just in case you like to do so. I haven't tried viewing any pictures, but that is also why I have a digital picture frame. You can't go wrong with this little beast. Slap a couple terabytes of hard drive space loaded with AVI rips and MKVs that you have found, and you'll be happy, just remember to make sure that you update the firmware as soon as you open the box or you may have some issues that are mentioned in other reviews (aside from those not being able to play unsupported codecs).. As for the firmware, I went with B-Rad's WDLXTV firmware, which adds tons of cool stuff. Note though, you can also damage your player if you are careless or mess with anything you have no experience in, such as advanced settings and other cool high-level Linux stuff. As usual, modding can void your warranty, and with any mods you do, no warranty is implied, enforced, or provided. Use at your own risk, should you go down that path..",679000,2013-08-25T09:24:12Z

Approx. 1 1/2 hours with Sony level 2 tech support (TERRIBLE!) + 1 hour Apple tech support (clueless) + 40 minutes (debating compatibility) with the guy at the camera shop = a returned ass $1000 camcorder. That's too much loot to beta test this for these guys!! Let Sony and Apple work out the compatibility kinks and wait for the price to come down meanwhile. It's still a good camera . . . if you can wait however long it's going to take to be able to download and edit video on your Mac..",680000,2010-02-18T07:28:36Z

I have been a Sonyite since I was a kid growing up on Trinitrons and The Walkman! Well worth the price of admittion to HD in grand style.

15977,816,"The zune out PERFORMS the touch hands down. When it comes to apps, the touch will always win. I personally, don't give two shizzes about apps. In my opinion, they slow performance of the media player, reduce battery life, and ***?? I have a computer for that stuff!! I DON'T NEED THAT. What I need is unbeatable playback quality, and the zune hd delivers that. Sound quality compared to the touch is outstanding. Video quality is no comparison. Battery life sure exceeds the touch as well. I am an audiophile. For people that do not know what that is, use a dictionary. I have a pair of $300 headphones, that sound like garbage on a touch, but the zune hd brings them to LIFE!. I'm in the market for a media player that can offer insane sound quality without sacrifising any performance. The zune hd DELIVERS. All audiophiles know that ipods sound reproduce garbage like sound, muffled and tinny. The zune opens up everything possible. Bring your headphones to life with the zune hd, and your eyes because of the amazing video quality. there is no hold button, which i am not happy, nor disappointed about. So i didnt mention it in a pro or con. The pros and cons on it are offset. all in all, this is the best media player money can buy.

As of June 2006, the Dell 1907FP can be shipped with one of three different display panels, a AOU M190EN04, a LG-Phillips LM190E03, or a Samsung LTM190EX. Only the Samsung panel preforms up to the specifications, so you have a 1 in 3 chance of getting a good performing monitor, which is why the user reviews vary from VERY BAD to VERY GOOD.

6271,890,"This phone is fast. You can run 10 different apps and switch between between them in half a second. Web pages load fast, fast, fast over wifi (first phone to use 801.11n) and t-mobile 3g is more than adequate for my needs. Cloud connection with google services is pretty amazing. Voice to text is suprisingly awesome - I hardly ever bother with the onscreen keyboard now although it's as good as the iPhone in my opinion. I took me about a week to really figure out what the phone can do. But if you bother to read the manual unlike me, then you may learn how to operate the phone quicker. Coming from the iPhone OS, it took awhile for me to get over the fact that Andriod is different and initially I was expecting things to work as they do on the iPhone. But now that I've had the phone for a month, I'm in love with Andriod and can't imagine ever going back. Google so far has been super responsive to customer needs. They just released an over the air update to the OS that enables pinch-to-zoom in some of the native apps and cleaned up some 3G reception issues - and the phone has been out barely a month. Google has done incredible work here with Andriod - in a few years it has brought it to a level where it competes with the iPhone OS and there's no signs of it slowing down. The devleoper community for andriod is growing and apps get better with time and an increasing user base. The andriod market has a 24 hour return policy on all apps which helps foster useful, high quality apps over sheer quantity. Apple will have to have to pull out something truly awesome with iPhone 4.0 to reclaim the title of best smartphone and I'm glad there's some competition now as it means great things for the users of these devices..",689000,2012-07-08T17:24:34Z
18465,854,"It still amazes me how companies like Microsoft, Apple and Sony have not even come close to developing what I and what most people want. In the industry, they call it the Holy Grail - the complete media center solution. I think the answer is pretty straight forward but these companies have not even come close - but Apple is the closest at the moment.. I, like a lot of people, have over 200 DVDs. I want to store them all onto a hard drive. You are looking at around 1TB of DVD data taking up too much physical storage space. I want all of that data to be on a hard drive.. Also, I have 100s of CDs - I want all of that data stored LOSSLESS on a drive too - that is another 200-300gb of data. Not to mention all of my photos, videos and future HD content that I want to store.. Bottom line - I need 2TB of storage to feel future proof.. OK, so lets say I buy the hard drive. Now, I want to hook it up to a good quality DAC (Digital Analog Converter) that has good software to organize my media and has a pleasant interface.. So lets take the Apple. It doesn't handle all of the formats necessary - so an instant failure. It ONLY talks to iTunes. It doesn't support 1080p and I doubt whether it is capable of pumping out good quality 5.1 surround sound.. What I also find annoying is that you cannot stream a DVD which is playing on your PC to the AppleTv. Which still means you need to have a DVD player/recorder and tuner.. I like the idea of the media streaming from your desktop or laptop. I could use my laptop to organize my media and then use the remote to navigate through it on the TV.. I recently bought a PS3 and am very dissapointed with its claims of being a media center. PS3 and Xbox360 are not comprehensive enough to really work as media centers.. If Apple was smart, they should have designed a device that can handle streamed data in every media format AND from your laptop's DVD player. They should have included a tuner.. I also don't know if you will be able to connect an external hard drive to the unit and play the media on that as well.. Bottom Line: Apple is on the right track here. BUT their first product is very dissapointing - it could have truly been the Holy Grail of home media entertainment..",690000,2010-01-22T05:41:56Z

If you research, you will find that Panasonic's players, while really nice, will randomly pause movies for 5 to 10 seconds.

3508,790,"Got this Camera 3 weeks ago and debated over the 40D.. This camera is just very pleasant to use and learn. Lots of flexibility and excellent noise reduction beyond ISO 800.. Top-notch LCD display and awesome/quick 51 point AF.. Quite impressive good/useable low-lite photos without using the built-in flash. Its worth the $500 diifference over the 40D IMHO. I like the 18-200MM lens (27-300mm equiv.) package w/c eliminates or minimizes lens-switching w/c also reduce the risk of debris getting in your camera. Almost got the 40D w/ 2 Canon lenses (equiv. to Nikon 18-200mm VR) but the thought of the inconvenience switching lenses swayed me towards the D300. Not to mention D300's 12 Mp resolution over the 40D's 10 Mp. Bottom line you can't go wrong with either!. It boils down to pre-owned gear, economics, and. personal taste/ preferences. BTW I upgraded from an OLYMPUS E500 8Mp-dual lens which I plan to keep. Got my D300 at a local Ritz Camera store. Great service! If your considering either cameras I strongly suggest to do your homework and try them out at your local camera store before making that investment.

3089,527,"The hardware is nice, but it runs extremely hot. This will probably impact the lifespan of the drive.. The software that comes with this unit is so poorly written it's laughable. The local client and the web client partially overlap in terms of function. The term user and share are used inconsistently between the two. They also act differently when creating user accounts. It can be confusing.. The web interface doesn't use SSL so the admin password is sent in clear text. This could be a concern in environments that use wireless connections.. The most glaring deficiency is that the backup excludes a number of critical data elements, including, of all things, Outlook E-mail, which is typically located under Documents and Settings on XP and earlier.. Seagate support recommends exporting Outlook data into a supported directory. Total nonsense.. It will not backup other OS-related directories either. In fact, what is being called backup is nothing more than a severely restricted file copy. There are no provisions to backup the registry, system state, file attributes, permissions or to perform incremental backups.. I should mention that you can copy your Outlook pst files to the drive manually (remember to close Outlook first!).. I found the software to be lacking many features found on comparable products, including support for Linux, RAID, FTP, SCP, etc.. If you want a full backup, run Microsoft's Backup and have it use the mapped drive to this device as the location for the backup files. That's the only way I know of to get a full backup..

2343,351,"This is a detailed review of the Garmin Nuvi 660, which I'm returning after 2 weeks of light use for the following reasons, in rank order, with most flaws exposing a shocking lack of thoughtfulness in Garmin hardware and process flow design. I hope it saves people time if they value their time and money.. 1) Inferior routing algorithm that makes the types of errors that none of my other 3 on-board car gps systems make. Silly things like getting off the highway 3 exits early to take local roads filled with stoplights. And yes, I'm sure the route preference setting is on quick not short.. 2) On the map, it doesn't show the direction of the next turn. This omission is a deal-killer, too. I cannot believe Garmin does not have this because it's so basic a need. You HAVE to know which way to turn next, especially if the mapview is compressed along the vertical axis and you can't see which way the route meanders.. 3) The mp3 capability is a complete waste of hard disk space because the sound coming out of it totally, totally stinks. It's beyond bad. It's good enough for the nav voice guide, but horrible for music. Do NOT consider this a selling point at all because you will never use it, except for the expensive audiobook capability, perhaps.. 4) The system does not automatically shut off when you turn the ignition off. The Garmin stays on!!! Maybe this is to encourage you to remove the device and put it in the glove compartment for security reasons, but I park only in secured garages, so this is a pain.. 5) Even when you remove the unit and it turns off, if the power cord is still in the car's power outlet (unattached to the actual gps unit), the green light on the cord shows that power is still being fed through the cord -- EVEN WHEN THE CAR IS OFF!! This is a fatal error because if I park at the airport for a week, I'm going to be a bit annoyed when I find after a midnight arrival that the battery has been drained.. 6) When a user enters addresses, most good systems will show a first default screen listing the last cities entered so that you can select them. In this NUVI 660, you have to spell out the city name each time. Annoying and shows a lack of thoughtfulness in the workflow design.. 7) On mapview, it tells you the estimated arrival time, but I care more about distance to destination. Why not show both or if Garmin wants, it should let me choose which one I want. Or it should tell you BOTH. What makes this more maddening is that the mapview screen doesn't tell you what time it is, so then, you have to look at the estimated time of arrival and look at your watch or console clock and subtract the time to get estimated minutes to arrival. This is moronic.. In summary, for around $850 of hard-earned cash, this thing is barely acceptable in my opinion. People who rave about this system have obviously never used the Acura, Lexus, or BMW console navigation systems, which all have their own quirks, but are much better than this 3rd party outboard unit. I would have expected better, given that Garmin's sole focus is nav systems..",711000,2008-01-14T13:30:10Z

It also says low battery, please wait although it's been charging for days. Apple support informed me that the ipod needed repair. I was told that I would have to pay to have the ipod shipped back to them. I was given the option of paying $59.99 for shipment that includes a 1 yr extended warranty or $32 for shipment alone. I opted for the $32. However, apple said it would take 3 wks for repair, 2 days to receive the return pkg needed to return the ipod, plus ? days for DHL to pick up the ipod. Meanwhile the warranty period is ticking away and I'm not given any compensation for the time that the ipod is under repair. I am truly outraged! Why should I have to pay anything for a defective product that is still under warranty! It should not cost $32 to ship an ipod! Most companies will fix or replace a product under warranty at no cost to the consumer. I was told that it would cost about $300 to repair if the warranty had expired, OR I could trade it in and get a 10% discount on a new one! No thanks!

For what it brings, its a really good price; my mom got it for only $150 with a plan. Its a really good phone for people over 12, its kind of hard to figure out if you are younger. It has a good full QWERTY keyboard, but its hard to get used to at the beginning. Theres also a setting where you can write the letters, but its not too smart. The T9 is, though, and I use it quite often. I think the touch screen is perfect, its pretty sensitive. The only issue is that it goes crazy sometimes and stops working, but that happens very rarely. I love how you can text vertically, its useful for when you have 1 hand full. I would have liked it more if you could flip it to the side to do everything, but you can only do that for games and texting. Like any touch screen, the screen gets dirty and greasy easily, but theres products for that. What I was REALLY upset with, though, is its memory space.

19650,323,"*With exorbitant prices for minimal returns.. After researching various publications and material (1) and through personal observation (2), I was convinced that this set would provide the maximum quality for a reasonable price. There are certainly better quality Plasmas out there (Pioneer), but these come with price premiums that do not justify what I found to be relatively minimal differences in quality. Perhaps I am not as discerning or observant as others, but as a long time PC gamer, I would like to think I have a reasonable eye for good image quality. If you are in the market for a 42 television, and would be comfortable around the $1000 range, you will be hard pressed to find a set with the same value provided by the TH-42PX80U.. As an aside, I was very happy with ordering through Amazon. I got the set for 984, no tax, free white glove delivery. The set came 6 days later; two delivery guys brought it inside, unboxed it, helped attach the stand, and made sure the TV was working before I signed for it.. Note: I believe this TV should be rated a 9 (perhaps slightly higher), but have submitted a 10 due to irrational logic of previous voters (A damaged TV could be one of the few Panasonic sent out, due to damage during delivery, or any number of other potentially damaging activities. Voting down a product based on one bad experience demonstrates an absurd sense of logic and statistical knowledge.. 1 - AVS Forum, CNet, ARS Technica, Consumer Reports. 2 - Via Circuit City, Best Buy, etc..",717000,2013-01-10T01:29:14Z

9050,515,"I finally had the money to get a new digital camera which I had been wanting for about 1 year but was not high on the list of priorities since the current one still worked. I was going for a point and shoot originally but then got given some money towards a camera and decided that it was worth to spend 500cdn instead of 300 and get a great camera to keep for a number of years. This one fit the bill. My price range was up to 600cdn dollars for the camera and my competitors were the Panasonic Lumix Fz-7 and the Sony H5. The Fz-7 was lightning fast but used expensive battery packs and apparently the durability wasn't the best, and the Sony H5 disapointed me when i found out that the highest shutter speed was (if i remember correctly) 1/1000th and would be low for capturing action shots, as well the flash could take up to 17 sec. to recharge thus the chance of missing photos ops. Also, if you want to take a few movie shots, the Canon has a quieter lens so when zooming you won't get lens noise in the audio.. I settled for the Canon, Sturdy, quick, solid build and great battery life. (I bought Energizer NIMH 2500mAh and have taken approx 600 photos and a few movie clips on a charge as well as uploaded photos and movies [movies are HUGE files] around 4 times and there is still no low batt symbol....runs on those 4 AA's for long time!) I was impressed with the shutter speed and easy to use manual controls via the toggle switch when in Manual mode or some of the other manual option modes. The camera feels solid in your hand and the large grip is great. I wish it came with a hood for those bright outdoor shots (otherwise buying a hood for it from Canon costs 50cdn bucks!! Way too much for a screw on piece of plastic! ) I am pleased with the startup time. If you see somethign to take a photo of...its on in seconds....and ready instantly. The burst mode is decent and if you see photos you need to take there is no lag to upload to the memory card, even a slower one which i used while waiting for my 2GB high speed 133x card. Although using a highspeed card like that there is a noticeable difference in how quick the camera saves photos. I am pleased with the quality of the movies. i took a few shot shots and found them to be excellent. I also tested the flash and it lit up most medium sized rooms well.....and if your subjects aren't moving too much...just turn down the shutter speed to about 1/50 indoors...and you don't need the flash (this can be REALLY helpful if you don't want that glare of the flash or are taking pictures that involve glass, or reflectants). Last off, the zoom can be quick to zoom in ....just pull on the toggle all the way and it zooms in instantly. The focus can have problems if there is not enough light at 12x zoom but otherwise is great. The ois (optical image stabilizer) works excellent! i can take hand held shots using both optical and digital and get a clear image.. For anyone who is an amateur but really into photography or wants a good camera that has plenty of features to appease for under $550cdn...This is the route to go!.",721000,2013-12-03T13:05:29Z

As someone who has resisted the mass movement to phones that do everything but make phone calls, I was hesitant to upgrade to new technology. (I don't like talking on the phone, so having a phone that does a bunch of other stuff has limited appeal to me.) This phone is so easy to use! The call quality is great, I really haven't had to use the owner's manual (which is quite detailed), and I'm very pleased with the physical unit itself. Also, for my needs, the $9.99 data plan is plenty. Having heard that Verizon wireless is going to get the iPhone, I'll probably make the leap.

More stable than Windows XP will ever be, I have found Windows 2000 Pro to be a truly dedicated OS that will run contemporary software, most games (despite it's business-class) and will allow you to compute with confidence.. With it's intuitive Win9x interface, it looks ready to go without being daunting, yet it is not Win9x by a long stretch. Based entirely on 32 bit Windows NT, Microsoft squeezed every little hint of DOS out of this OS, and it was such as good OS, that they based the Windows XP Operating System on it.. The Uptime is easily server-like and reboot is only necessary when you configure a new device, make a big registry change or hack the hack in MSConfig. What I said in my summary? Ignore the folklore about MS instability. The only thing I would recommend before connecting to the Internet is to turn off the Windows Messenger Service, either in the Services applet or via this website: http://www.grc.com/stm/shootthemessenger.htm.

8294,752,"I am currently using the BB Curve 8330 on Verizon. I'm up for NE2, and have been in and out of the Verizon store playing with this phone, but just see no reason to change. First of all, this phone, like the Curve, has no wi-fi. I dunno, not that I really need it, but hey BB, you put wi-fi on the Storm, AND the Storm2 (which also is going to suck (with a slightly better version of the same horrible keyboard WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?!?) (please prove me wrong) why not put wi-fi on the Tour? I like the screen, but the browser seems about as (un)usable as the one on my current Curve. I mean, on a continuum of web-browsers on phones, between my Curve and the GeOhDee iPhone, there is no question that the Tour's browser is way closer to the Curve. Why spend more money on the same sht? You don't get rich wasting money. I'd rather be rich than throw $200 at some bs. The WorldPhone feature of this will have way more value as something to brag about (for most dudes, than females) than any real life practicality. If I'm not here, I'm somewhere for work, THEY can figure out my world internet solution thanks Plus, the 8820 already had the Worldphone feature. If I had THAT, NO WAY I'm getting this. Unless I wanted a camera LOL. This is just a higher res 8830 with a camera, or, a higher res 8330 with world features. Congratulations for such leaps forward TWO years later BBerry. While the screen is nicer, the overall benefit over other phones is minimal as the web browser still sucks and there is still not enough real estate to truly surf. My hope for the Droid stems at least 40% from the fact that I want to upgrade and Berry's current options are so uncompelling. I can't believe you guys stuck with a different version of the same horrible hardware for the Storm2 as well (nah this one *vibrates* yeah you still have to press the screen hard, but at least the screen doesn't move this time).

I've programmed the printer button on the back to take movies so if I'm taking stills and a movie situation arises I just press the button and I'm taking movies! It's small enough that I carry it in my shirt pocket everywhere I go. I can have it out of my pocket, (and sock case) turned on and taking pictures in just a couple of seconds. I take lots of pictures and I hardly ever miss one now thanks to the quick turn on time. It also has a continuous shoot mode - just hold the shutter button down and it takes pictures until the memory card fills or you release the shutter button. I found a good deal on 1G SD cards at Calumet Photo. I bought 2 extra batteries and carry about 6 1G SD cards and the extra batteries in my pocket. I can shoot all day with that setup. I have a Canon Digital Rebel that I used to take everywhere I went. That camera with the 28-135 IS lens and battery grip weighs about 3.5 lbs. The 850 weighs about 7 oz - quite a bit lighter!

13746,417,"I've use Panasonic bridge cameras for a few years and this time they've really got it right. The larger sensor isn't a big deal but the new Venus IV engine makes the big difference. It manages to bring out all the quality the Leica designed lens is capable of producing.. I first got a Panasonic FZ8 for the over 400mm lens capability. Seemed cheaper to get the camera at about $300 then a dSLR lens for over twice that. Didn't use long lenses much so it seemed the way to go.. Fell in love with the FZ8. Gave that one to my daughter for photographing birds and moved up to an FZ18. The FZ18 is magnificent. Took it to Europe and printed a show of big prints for a gallery. Great color, great tonality.. Debated getting the FZ28 but after much thought and conversation with other photographers decided to give it a try. I am very happy I did.. I am a pro and I have and shoot Nikon dSLRS. The new FZ28 produces images that are comparable to the images from my D80. And i'm talking about comparing 11x17s side by side.. This is a great camera. Its perfect for the photo enthusiast looking to move up to a better camera then a point and shoot and the perfect carry camera for a pro who doesn't need to take their dSLRs with them all the time.. Needless to say I will use the FZ28 on jobs where I need an extra long telephoto lens.. I like it that you can use the FZ28 as a totally Automatic camera or use it in total manual control mode. It does take a little practice to get the hang of the zoom and using the camera in macro mode etc but the learning curve will be quick for most people.. Panasonic has happily dealt with the noise issues that diminished the ratings of their otherwise astonishing cameras. At 100 and 200 ISO I can't find any noise and at 400 and 800 there is some noise but nothing that will show up on 8x10 prints.. The EVF screen is smaller than on the FZ18 or FZ8 and is a bit harder to use. Not a big problem but it is smaller. THe LCD monitor is bigger and it might have been nice if it was rotatable but these are minor issues..

14794,908,"I have always hesitated when it came to getting an iPod. As a DJ/Sound Engineer, lossy audio (and video for that matter) compression just doesn't appeal to me one bit. So I've waited for almost 5 years and since there still isn't a 500 gig ipod available to hold all my current mp3 files, I've decided to settle for this baby and just use it for my special DJ mixes. It seems like just enough storage space to hold all my live or studio DJ mixes in their full .wav (windows) uncompressed formats. This seems to work for me for now. I currently have about 3 days worth of DJ sets stored in this thing in their full uncompressed wav formats and that took me about 3 years to compile (1 mix set recorded every other weekend). That's over 70 CD-length DJ mixes which is about 40 gigs worth of memory. So I figure by the time I run out of space, it should be time for an upgrade. Besides, I'm also experimenting with converting my mixes (for iPod use only) to .m4a at 384 kbps, the highest possible sampling rate on a lossy format that I know of (which to me means the least apparent deterioration of audio quality). That would shrink the audio (and video) files to just over a quater of their original size, greatly increasing the practical capacity of my 80 gig iPod.. However, that whole iTunes-only compatible issue is a major let-down. I understand that Apple needs to make money but come on, opening the iPod in general to be compatible with other software would greatly increase it's appeal!

17041,854,"I wanted to make this GPS work so bad. I have been using Garmin for a long time now and was between the 2820 and the Uvi 660. Due to the size and the built ins I went for the Nuvi 660. Sams Club was having a sale on them and I could not resist.. So I bring home my new 660 and charge it up. I then try to turn it on and it locks up. So I call Garmin, which has the best customer service, and they told me to take it back and get an exchange. This stuff happens so I went back and got a new one.. This one started up thank goodness but I was unable to find a FM channel to use so I can have handsfree over the radio. Even then I was OK, the 2820 can't go through the radio either so there is no reason to get that one instead. I use my cell phone a lot so I was looking forward to the handsfree feature. The problem is that the speaker is a little weak and I had complaints from people I was talking to about noise and them hearing themselves talk. Then I found out that you can't use a bluetooth earpiece with this system but you can on the 2820.. Since I drive a lot I use my GPS more than most people. When you frive that often you find that there are certain roads or areas that you NEVER want to drive on and avoid forever. The 2820 and the 2720 allow you to make cutom avoidances so the GPS always makes your route around that area. For example, I live in Houston, and if I wanted to go to North Houston the GPA will take me through the center of Downtown Houston to get there. If you do that you will wan to drive your vehicle off a bridge after sitting through that nightmare of a route. I would rather take one of the loops that goes around instead. With my 2720 it would avoid that area and just route me around it without me having to detour every time.. The other thing is the lack of remote. The remotes come in so handy when driving. If you haven't used a remote you don't know what you are missing. Volume control is easier and bluetooth functions are easier.. Another feature lacking is the categories under favorites This way you can have diferent categories for finding fanorites easier, like: restaurants, work, personal, vacation, etc. For this price of unit it should have better if not as good of options as the same priced 2820. I do like the battery powered function and how small the unit is but those pluses don't make up for all the minuses!!!!. I returned mine yesterday and now have a 2820 on order.

Samsung indicated that the allowable engineering tolerance is 10 mm (1/4 to 1/2 inch) for this set, and that this set was within acceptable engineering tolerances.. Needless to say, I did not find this acceptable and returned the set for good. I was so irate that I performed an additional investigation and visited my local CC and Tweeter and their display models had the same visible issue.. If you do not mind the fact that the image within this set is crooked, please feel free to purchase this set. If you are as discerning as I am, I would not recommend ths set. I challenge anyone out there to take a tape measure with them when they view this set at their local electonics store and request that the menu box or a channel with a ticker be brought up on the set. You will discover that the left or right side is 1/4 to 1/2 inch higher on one end and that it is not limited to just the bottom of the screen. Wait for a large logo to be present on the screen and it will be tilted in the center of the screen.. Although not as large, I purchased the Samsung LN52A650 and could not be happier..",755000,2008-09-23T12:29:45Z

Low and behold my lost camera showed up on my doorstep and gave me a chance to compare the two. This new model is substantially thinner and a bit shorter (~1/8). The shot isn't that much better though. I thought 6 megapixel would blow away a 3.2 megapixel camera, but when you zoom in on photoshop, the quality is hard to discern. Nice video options and I like the high ISO800 feature. If you don't have a camera yet, this is a sweet deal. If your looking to upgrade, I would hold off..",756000,2014-12-06T12:06:24Z

After only a month and a half it would not charge normally. We sent it back and they said the problem was from miss use which COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH!!! so now we are stuck with a $300 piece of junk that doesn't work properly!!! Oh but they'll give us 10% off another one or we can pay $149 to get that one fixed-well that's what they first said but after I quizzed on the specifics of the repair ie what parts would be need replacing how long would it take to repair etc. I was told I'd actually be sent a refurbished unit!!!

19063,723,"I acquired this unit from DISH in April of 2006 in order to view Orlando network channels and several additional channels in HD. The unit was hooked up with no problems by the DISH installer with one notable exception: The HDMI hookup to my Phillips LCD TV did not function! I had this same problem with the DISH's previous HD DVR. They continue to tell me they're still working on resolving the problem.. The HD picture using the component cables looks very good. The unit is easy to operate, but offers little improvement over the previous model. Most notably, the HD recording capacity is still only 25 hours, which can be used up fairly quickly.. Here I should also note that, almost 10 months after receiving this unit DISH still has not upgraded its Orlando network stations to HD, in spite of their representations that all top 25 markets (Orlando is #19) would be upgraded to HD by May of 2006.. A continual frustration I experience when using this unit is the frequency of notices telling me to run the Point Disk diagnostic. I'm unable to use the unit until I run this diagnostic (everything's always fine) or turn the unit off and on a few times.. Another scary notice I've received several times states that the hard drive is corrupted and that I must completely erase it before it may be used again.

2099,351,"I recently upgraded to a Dish 622 receiver. The HD programming was perfect, but the SD programming was very poor quality. I described the picture as grainy with color bleed. This was on both my brand new HD tv and on my existing tv. The tech was 7 hours late showing up for the install (scheduled for 8-12am and showed at 7pm) and I only had it on HD channels while he was there so I didn't see the problem with the SD channels until he left. The tech was very nice and left his personal phone # so I called him first thing the next morning. He said he's seen this same problem about 10 times and it's a receiver problem. Even so, I called DIsh and they sent me a replacement receiver. Same problem with the replacement. Called Dish again, and they scheduled another installer visit. He ran a cable straight from the dish to the receiver to eliminate all house wiring and the problem still existed where HD pic was flawless and SD pic is grainy. I was using an HDMI cable. We also tried S video and the banana jacks and all 3 methods looked poor. (Also keep in mind I had Dish before and I know what the pic quality should be with SD programming from them.) The 622 was nowhere close to the quality I had before with my 625 receiver. This installer called several co-workers and 2 of 3 guys he called admitted seeing this problem several times before. I called Dish again. This time they sent a regional technical manager to my house. He didn't even try an experiment to fix the problem. He acknowledged this as a known problem with the receiver and that there was nothing he could do to resolve the issue. I called Dish yet again. THey wanted to sent another tech to my house by I refused to continue on with this painful waste of my time. I sheduled an installer to come rip out everything HD and returned to my 625 receiver and have good quality picture again, I just don't have HD.

The tuner is so good that it picks up HD channels that I'm not expecting to receive with my SD cable package! I've enjoyed watching college football in HD this fall!. The color is not so good out of the box. The presets that are programmed into the TV do not improve things either. HOWEVER, there is a very simple solution that most novices can handle. Look through your DVD collections until you find one that has the THX Optimizer included as a feature (I have it on my Terminator 2 DVD). Use this to dial in the correct colors (it's self-explanatory). Once this is done, the picture looks amazing!. Finally, the price. I was able to find this brand new (NOT refurbished) at Sears for less than $500 after incentives and discounts!. We've had it for one month now and are very satisfied.

17,760,"I bought a Nuvi 670 on sale for $479CDN. vs a TomTom GO920($449). Why, well it's like this. Garmin has the rep and the 670(660) has the reviews in a now time tested package and debugged vs. GO920(720) that are loaded with features but have questionable reliability and company service. Of 3 top consumer magazine reviews the 670 came out on top of the TomToms, mostly on navigating performance. Even so I might never have noticed myself, but there were other reasons. I have no preference for brand, only a best value.. 1. My personal preference for the screen display was Garmin. It was in my opinion that it was clean, bright, unclutterd, and provided just the right info for me. The short cuts on the map and main menu give me quick access to my most important funtions, and side by side it takes up to half the button presses to do the same operation as the TomTom.. 2. Customizing my Garmin to perform how I like it is a breeze. I can change my vehicle settings to give me more warning time for when I'm towing a rig, and set up blue tooth to do most everything hands free and over the vehicle sound system. Things it will do that TomTom won't: Broadcast phone calls from bluetooth phone over car FM radio. Adjust separate MP3 volume and navigation volume so you can balance them out for a pleasant experience instead of volume adjusting all the time. The phone over the FM stereo is a big one, as you need the extra volume if you use the phone as I am to replace the Onstar system.. 3. All phones I've seen tried have worked with the 670, not so with the GO920. My LG muzik and LG shine hook up and work 100%. I use the Nuvi 670 as my main system in my 2008 GMC sierra 3500hd, replacing the expensive onstar calling and navigation. As soon as I get in my truck and place the Nuvi in the holder( no power cable fiddling is nice) it hooks up bluetooth and gives me directions, hands free calling(using the LG's voice dial via bluetooth, which is awesome thru the Nuvi), and my MP3 music all at once, automatically pause one to allow the more important funtion to broadcast over vehicle's stereo. A cost effective and highly enjoyable alternative to mimic Onstar features. One year subscription to onstar pays for my Nuvi, and phone calls are free on my cell plan vs. Onstars $0.47/min. TomTom will not give me phone over the FM transmitter, but will do music and navigation.(OOPS?). 4. I was nervous about the weak Garmin FM transmitter, but with my setup it works great. I use the dash mount adesive pad that the suction cup sticks to and mounted the unit on the dash right above my stereo controls of my 2008 GMC truck. Touching the unit is as easy as touching the stereo for both driver and front passenger, and the flip up antennae has a clear view out the sloping windsheild. I also believe that the 600 series nuvis have better reception than the 700/800 integrated antennae units, but only by reviews I've seen.. 5. Mounting hardware is night and day better on the Garmin, suction cup performance isn,t even in the same league. Period. Same with FM traffic antennae, and Garmin came with case and all ac/dc/usb hookups.. 6.I did mention the seperate volume controls, which had me almost taking the Garmin back before I found them and improved the balance so one volume setting on car stereo was balanced between the MP3 and navigation voice. Not on the TomTom that I nor any one else could find.. 7. Garmin updates from their website was easy and instant, and free new 2008/2009 updates for maps of Europe and North America on the way.. 8. I was really, really tempted by the user updated maps on the TomTom. I was really tempted by the extra routing capacity and some of it's more modern features. I was drooling to have voice activated navigation of the GO920, but after using the nuvi paired to the phones voice controls and phone book, I am happier with what I have now.. In summary, it's what you want, what you will pay for, for features and performance, I went with proven tech, multiple award winning reviews,easiest use, proven navigation, and stayed away from the unproven new product that generates a 'perceived' excessive amount of problems( TomTom Go series). A few features on the Garmin made my personal preference the Nuvi 670, but on a price to feature ratio I would not hesitate to tell a friend about the GO920, depending on how they were going to use it.. If any one has info on these two devices that may shed more light on which is more suitable for use in other situations please feel free to respond..",791000,2011-03-09T08:11:56Z

In general this is a good console, although there are some very common problems with early models, such as fatal hardware errors like the red ring of death, although Microsft has claimed to have reduced the number of defective units for sale. Buyers should be adviced to keep their buy tickets and their properly sealed warranty policies in a safe place as they are more likely to need them than with other game consoles..",800000,2009-02-25T11:27:21Z
7118,994,"I have found the Garmin C330 very easy to setup and use. It did not come with a manual (available online) and it was not necessary to use for the first time.. The mount is marvelous and has all of the adjustability one would want.. My issue is the POIs. It is supposed to have 6 million in the North American version. The first day I used it I searched for a Buffalo Wild Wings that has been open for two years. It was not in the database. I then searched for a Kohl's and Sports Authority that has also been open at least two years. They were not in the database.. I tried to call and stayed on hold on the phone for 1 1/2 hour without talking to anyone. I sent an email and was told that I could update the map and POI database for $69.99. This flabbergasted me because out of the box the POIs were not up to date and they did not have a free download. How about letting a new customer do that the first time especially when the database is out of date.. On the other hand, what I am afraid to do is spend the $70.00 and find that the 2008 version still does not have POIs that are 4 miles from my house. I do not live in Wyoming, rather, New Lenox, IL which has a population of about 30,000 people..",801000,2012-07-25T18:33:39Z

5160,400,"I set up the TV with one other person. One power connection and one HDMI connection. I did not hang it as we have 80 year old horse hair plaster and the thought of putting holes in an otherwise pristine wall and risking watching my $1,900 TV come loose and smash to the floor was too much to picture. I got my stand from BDI (Model 9649). My components are Denon AVR 2808CI, Panasonic DMP-BD35AK (Costco) Blu-Ray, Boston Acoustic SW, and all KEF center/fronts/surrounds speakers. I've not set up the surrounds pending delivery of 12 AWG oxygen-free cable from Monoprice.. My recommendation? I agree completely with CNET's review. I did months of research and this TV is the best. As I said, it is like looking out a window. The Blu-Ray picture just carries you right into the scene.. I STRONGLY recommend that the first thing you play on the TV is with Blu-Ray, and that disc MUST be PLANET EARTH. Play at least 30 minutes. Trust me - you will say Oh My (pick your deity)!!. This is especially important if you live in a snowy cold climate. The image of blooming blossoms and sun when outside is gloomy and the snow isn't pristine sparking white anymore is simply overwhelming!. I received the TV on 1/14. I went on vacation on 1/15 and only returned on 2/1. I had already seen some of PLANET EARTH before I left. Even though I spent 10 sunny warm days away from New England winter, I felt like I was coming home to another vacation with this TV!. I know this is not your normal review, but I'll bet this is what you wanted to hear! No statistics, no wavelength comparisons.. Remember when Alice fell into the rabbit hole and found herself in Fantasy Land? Get this TV, get a Blu-Ray player (I have the Panasonic DMP-BD35AK, but you make your choice. BTW, CNET rates this one VERY highly), and you will find yourself in Never-Never Land! If I'm mixing Disney movie themes, my apologies.. I'm just really happy with my purchase.. I got mine from Costco. They had it available for about 2 days @ $1,799 + $90 tax. No delivery charge. The delivery was a little frustrating as it was supposed to come from Georgia by a specialized logistics carrier but wound up coming from California to New England by UPS. The local delivery driver couldn't wait to get it off the truck!. OK, now for the bottom line summary before my computer hangs:. The TH-50PZ500U rocks. You will not be sorry..

So I contacted their sister company that does recovery and they want anywhere from $1000 to $3000 to recover it. I COULD HAVE BOUGHT A BACKUP COMPUTER FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY!

11768,975,"Let's make one thing clear first; I am an avid opponent of the iPod. While I don't think it's a bad product by any means, I find their humongous, blind following (as well as annoying advertising campaign) off-putting. However, I never thought there would be another media player that would actually compete with it. The 1st generation Zune had a decent idea, but by that time, Apple was ready to shock the world with the iPod Touch. It took 4 years, but I think the new Zune HD lineup has the ammo to actually fight back.. All of the features of the original Zune are still present, but Microsoft was smart to see what the newest line of iPods was capable of doing, and do it one better. That one would definitely have to be the HD radio tuner. The sound is great, and an untrained ear would definitely confuse it for an mp3. Plus, it shares the HD radio feature of grabbing songs you hear on the radio, and saving them for download the next time you hook up the Zune to the marketplace.. The screen is gorgeous to look at, and a breeze to navigate. It was mentioned that controlling volume on the go is a little difficult with it being completely based on the touch screen, but the buttons are so big that it only becomes an issue if you can't actually look at it. Videos look fantastic, with no stuttering.. Now we get to the one ***** in the armor: the apps. It's a smart idea to have the option for apps, as it seems to be all that the iTouch/iPhone kids talk about now. The only problem is that there ISN'T any. The Zune HD has been on the market for over half a year now as of this writing, and you can count almost all of the available Marketplace apps on your fingers. What's worse, the apps that are available are certainly less than stellar; there's a few decent games, and almost NO useful utilities. What's that, iTouch owner? You can look up restaurant reviews on your device? Well, I've got MSN weather...although it really only displays a 7-day forecast, and nothing else.. It's wonderful to see the Zune finally getting a lot of things right, and it's a wonderful device to have. My only gripe is that they need to come to their senses soon on the apps, and give people the complete Zune HD experience.. Updated. on Mar 22, 2010.",816000,2011-08-23T14:47:38Z

I use iPhoto and was a bit concerned that it would give me problems but it was so simple. I simply plugged in the supplied transfer cable and turned it on. iPhoto detected the camera instantly and gave me the option to upload my photos. I was concerned that the GPS tagging wouldn't work as the supplied disk specifies that it's for PCs only. I was happy to see that all my photos are geographically tagged..

12688,889,"Spectacular camera! Replacing 10 yr. old Sony MiniDV camera that finally took a dive. Placed this on backorder after researching HD camcorders for months. Recently took a trip to Branson Missouri and was amazed with picture quality. Went to a tobyMac concert took pictures. Great quality at 10.2 MP, easy to use even my wife can navigate which was important to the purchase. The ease of operation is amazing between movie and picture with a simple thumb move on the control. Patience has paid off  if you have more patience than me, you might wait for a slight price drop, which I am sure will happen in the months to come.. The Pros: Hard drive has a lot of space even with HD. 60GB is a lot. 120 on the SR12 is nice, but I have already taped hours on the 60GB with plenty of space. If you are one to procrastinate on transferring data, 120 might be the way to go. I went ahead and bought the 4GB Pro Duo card in lieu of the HDMI cable. Money spent either way and its easy to transfer the pictures or video to the Duo and put into the PS3. Conversion is simple and unbelievable. You can convert to standard DVD which is nice to play in the car for the kids to watch on long trips since its not AVCHD compatible. However, you can create both standard DVD-Video or the HD AVCHD which plays on PS3s or Blu-Ray players and transfer to a DVD. The camera fits perfect in my hands, almost the size of a larger digital camera. The touch screen took a little getting use too, but once you start navigating it becomes easier. The engineers got it right for the consumer on this one! Hot shoe available for an external flash. The quick on feature so you dont continuously turn on and off, but save battery power. 5.1 Dolby Digital! Face detection! Slightly time consuming on conversion to DVD, but well worth the wait. You can format picture size between 4:3 to 16:9. The features are endless and spot on for people to learn quickly at ease.. The Cons: the proprietary software (Sony needs to expand a little in this category with options on menus, etc.). The price, obviously ahead of the game on technology you will pay premium. HDMI cable not provided, but the card is nice. I was told by Sony tech support when researching cameras this was a 1080p and it is not. Windy situations picks up sound when taping, needs a wind filter. Be cautious at loud concerts, the microphone is sensitive and I was at a loud Christian concert where it sounds baffled. Could be I was 5 rows from the front stage though! Battery life is short on the battery provided, however, Im a believer to have an extra one handy and the NP-FH70 is a good purchase that lasted much longer than I expected  145 minutes or so. Overall, the SR11 is an excellent choice for HD fanatics! Im addicted and only owned it for a short period of time. Friends are in awe of the picture quality and envious! Although, my goal was to replace an old camera that failed on me. This purchase by far was worth the money. The conversion to DVD was so easy, but be patient. The quality from HD to Dolby Digital and still pictures is phenomenal. I keep telling myself to not purchase Sony for several reasons and experience over the years (i.e., tech support, repair-terrible), but I end back with the purchase because of the cutting technology in the product..",826000,2009-05-27T04:20:13Z
20722,767,"My problems with setting up Slingbox had to do with port forwarding, which took several calls to tech support. Once set up though, I found out that my broadband speed was about half of what I was paying for, 800kbs. I had to get Qwest DSL to run a homerun cable to my modem, and now I get 1.3mbs download, and 840kbs upload, which makes my picture quality a lot better. I also ran a cat5e cable from my modem to my Slingbox, one floor above. So, the better the broadband connection, the better the picture, even with wireless, which is what I use. I have a Dish 722 DVR, so I can control and watch my own programing, instead of being stuck with BBC, Sky news, stuff in French, etc. I also find that I watch the news and stuff on my laptop wherever I am in the house, instead of sitting in front of the big TV in the living room. The main drawback is that the Slingbox Pro is not plug and play, but geeks will have no problems with it, and will love it. All others will probably have to get a geek to set it up for them, then they'll love it too!

17963,941,"first off I like windows 7 a lot I like it enough to convert all the pc's in my home to windows 7, the most basic computer in my house has 1GB ram,Intel Celeron D at 3.06GHZ, and Windows 7 runs smoothly enough on there.. My mum was first unsure about windows 7 but she even likes it and she is a novice when it comes to computers,she did have windows xp on there, but she finds windows 7 quicker and easier to use.. then there is my laptop it has an Intel Centrino 2 duo @ 2X 2.0GHZ it runs smoothly on there, i get over 4hrs battery life where as before with Windows Vista it used to have 3hrs:12mins battery life due to the fact my laptop was never idle. now let move onto the features. I use Devices and Printers a lot I find it is more simple as when Microsoft asked me what would make windows simpler I said a place where I could see all my devices instead of the 5 or so clicks you require to get into Windows Device manager.. Windows Media Center. I use Windows Media Center a lot as in the UK we don't have anything that comes close to TiVo yet.. So I have Freesat running in Windows Media Center and use it as my main DVR. my favourite feature is if it misses a program it will reschedule for example I wanted to record Scrubs but there was already two programs recording, it would reschedule scrubs to the +1 channel.. Also if you get the chance try the Microsoft Office 2010 beta it is really stable and is easy to use..",846000,2013-12-19T19:25:37Z

3968,966,"Sears delivered this TV this morning and it's nothing short of outstanding in almost every respect. I was seriously considering this TV and the Panasonic TC-P58V10. I spent many hours of research on each model. Both had strong suits and great reviews, but I chose the Samsung UN55B8000. My final decision was made based on the fact that the Samsung LED LCD had a superior contrast ratio. And I'm now convinced it was the right decision. The only distraction is a slight glare reflection from the screen but other than that, it delivers the best picture available. The wireless Widget access is also more convenient than an Ethernet connection. In conclusion, there's no buyers remorse here! This TV Rocks!.",853000,2009-04-02T06:03:21Z

16228,472,"I almost never submit online product reviews, but this product was so exceptional that I can honestly say it is one of the best pieces of electronic equipment I've ever owned...considering that I've got about a $10k investment in A/V equipment, I think that's really saying something! Here's some comments I have:. 1) This was my first foray into HDTV (first time I've had an HD feed, even though I've had a Sony XBR 40, 4:3 aspect ratio tube TV that supports HD for about 4 years now), and the HD picture quality is great...not perfect, but definitely worth the upgrade. Although the detail varies a bit with the feed, the average HD picture quality is very nice. Sports, movies, everything I've watched in HD has been very pleasing. The SD on this set also looks very good, but you'll find that if you watch HD programming regularly, you won't like going back to SD...you get so used to the detail HD provides that it kinda sucks going back to SD. The only real knock on the combination of this receiver with my TV is that there's a bit of flicker on text, and occasional artifacts on some solid colors, particularly reds...I'm a bit picky about stuff like this, whereas my wife doesn't really notice it. I'm running the box in 1080i mode, and maybe this would be improved with 720p, but my TV doesn't seem to like it when I switch to that mode...I guess the TV only supports 1080i for HD via its component input. Rating on this section: 8.5. 2) The DVR functionality is absolutely magnificient, from the simplicity in setting up recordings, to the HD playback capabilities (which look spot-on like the originals), to the pause/rewind live TV. The recording space is reasonable, except that if you do a lot of HD recording (where my main interests seem to lie), it can fill up surprisingly quickly...for example, being a big soccer fan, I got this stuff all setup just as the World Cup was starting, and was regularly recording HD feeds of two games per day. With the added-on time to make sure the entire games were recorded, I got close to running out of space before I had viewed the games. This is the only issue that keeps me from giving this a perfect 10 rating. Another neat feature is the ability to select which tuner is used for the DVR, so that you can watch/record a program on your main TV, while recording another program using second tuner (although the second TV is restricted to use that channel then)...may seem overkill to some folks, but it's come in handy a few times. Rating on this section: 9.5. 3) The menuing system is the most perfectly designed system I've experienced on an electronic product. It's extremely user-friendly, and has lots of neat features that just make sense, such as being able to scroll through the channel menus while watching the last channel is a 1/4 sized screen on the top right, and allowing you to scroll through the menu of channels one at a time while the currently selected channel takes up the entire screen. Very, very neat. Also, the speed on scrolling through the menus is EXCEPTIONALLY fast...none of this delay nonsense that used to happen with older cable and dish receivers. There's also almost no lag when you do select a channel. The speed of operation of this box suggests that the processing hardware they used to build it was well above average. For folks that do a lot of channel surfing like me, this is a huge benefit. Rating on this section: 10. 4) The extra tuner provided for a second TV (and I suppose a third, if you need the over-the-air tuner to get some HDTV channels that you can't get through Dish) is an awesome feature for a home that has one very high-quality HDTV, and a second SDTV (maybe in a small bedroom, like ours is). Our home previously had just a cheapo antenna on our bedroom TV, and going to this was a huge upgrade, without having to pay a second box fee per month! The RF remote is occasionally a bit flakey, but it mostly works OK. Rating on this section: 9.0. 5) My setup is probably a bit unusual for this box, but as I'm a techie-tweaker, I found the following setup to give me the most flexibility. One drawback to using this box with a 4:3 aspect ratio HDTV (the older models available 5 years ago or so) is it's inability to show all programs in native format automatically...in other words, for the 16:9 HDTV feeds, I want the aspect ratio to appear 16:9 with blank bands on the top and bottom of the screen, and similarly, for the 4:3 SDTV feeds, I want the picture to take up the entire 4:3 screen, instead of putting black bands on all four sides of the picture. If you don't mind manipulating the stretch feature everytime you switch between SD and HD channels, this works fine. My preferred approach instead, was to use multiple TV inputs, and toggle between the two using the tv/video button on my TV's remote. I used two sets of the receiver's main tuner outputs, the component output for the HD feed, and the S-video output for the SD feed...the S-video output is really pretty adequate for SD anyways. The HD feed via component cabling is always set to normal 16:9 mode, while the SD feed via S-video cabling is always set to stretch the 4:3 output to fill up the screen. The installer (while very good otherwise) was not able to figure this out, and it took me a while playing around with this stuff to get it to work as desired. It would've been nice if the box automatically interpreted the feed's aspect ratios correctly, but it doesn't on my TV, regardless of how I setup the aspect ratios in the HDTV setup menu. This approach allowed me to watch all programs in their native aspect ratios, while taking advantage of the full 4:3 screen size for SD programming...too often I've seen pictures that look warped/stretched incorrectly because the installers or users haven't taken the time to get the aspect ratio settings correct, and this just wouldn't have passed for my setup. Admittedly, most of you considering this box will have 16:9 HDTVs, and so none of this will pertain to you, as you'll watch 16:9 feeds at their native aspect ratio, and 4:3 feeds will have black bars on the left and right sides (unless you choose to stretch them to take up the entire 16:9 box, which just looks bad to me).. The second TV is connected via RG-6 coax, which for this low-end TV is adequate. I also have an SD output from the second tuner (using the RCA connector) going to my main HDTV, so that I can monitor what's being watched on the second TV in the bedroom. This is a neat feature for keeping an eye on what your kids are watching. This would also allow you to use PIP using the TV's capabilities, rather than the receiver's single/dual tuner mode/PIP. The drawback to this is that you need to have both remotes in front of you to actually use PIP this way, while the Dish receiver can do everything with the main remote only.. 6) Minor bugs I've experienced so far in about 6 weeks of operation: one lockup on the main tuner (which didn't affect the second tuner for some reason), which required a manual reset to recover from; occasional 'stuttering' of the picture (maybe once or twice a week) which happens for about 30 seconds, and then goes away; mismatched audio feed on the local HDTV channels in the Chicago area...I'm only seeing this issue on those channels which apparently use the MPEG-4 compression, so I can't be sure whether this is an issue with the MPEG decoder or the feeds themselves; box runs warm, but not hot to the touch...I would not install this is a cabinet, but in an open air rack with plenty of airflow available to it.. 7) Lastly, the manual is very well written, as least as far as I've gotten through it (about 1/2 way). I tend to try things out in the menus myself first, and then go back to reading manuals to see if there's anything I missed later on. This one seems very well put together, by someone who's actually spent some time with the box.. Overall, a superb product that I highly recommend!.",861000,2009-06-03T10:26:42Z
2421,450,"Echostar/Dish DTVPal DVR compared with Philips DVDR3576H. I would giv it 3 out of five stars if it actually worked.. Let me first say, ?DON?T ORDER THE DTVPal DVR until they fix the problems?. I got a defective machine and after seven hours of phone calls and letter writing, they haven?t replaced it. I am now working with VISA and hope they will refund my money. Even though this machine was paid in full and was working over 90% of the time, DISH deactivated it over-the-air and it no longer works at all. I wonder is Dish is not replacing my unit because they know they will be replacing it with another defective unit because that?s all they have. They won?t refund my money either.. Dishes site compares their DVR to the VIP 622 and VIP 722 satellite receivers. If those are race horses, the DTVPal DVR is a pony at best.. I will use words Dish and Philips for the Dish DTVPal DVR and Philips DVDR3576H.. Both receive and record HD and standard digital broadcasts. Only the Philips receives and records analog.. The Dish has a slightly larger hard drive but you cannot change the recording qualities. My Dish DVR only records about 110 hours of standard TV even though it says 150 hours on the box. You can set the Philips DVDR to record 66 to 198 hours of standard TV depending on the quality you want. I set my Philips to 99 hours and it seems to have the same quality picture as the Dish unit.. The Dish DVR records two channels at a time, but it is tricky?you have to set the longer show before you set the shorter shows or it won?t record two at a time. The Philips will only record one show at a time. Both units will play back an existing recording while you are making a recording. Both will also play back a current recording while you are recording it. For example, you can start recording a three hour football game and start watching it an hour later and skip the commercials, time-outs etc. I usually start about two hours into a game and finish at the same time. I can even watch every play in less than 30 minutes with either machine.. The Philips let you watch DVD?s or record to writeable DVD?s as well as the hard drive. I connected my VCR to my Philips DVDR and I copy my tapes to the hard drive. Because the Philips machine has an editing feature, I then edit out items I don?t want and record it to a DVD. You can record one to six hours depending on the quality setting. The DVD?s menu then shows each recording, but it always shows one extra menu choice which is empty. It only records standard definition to a DVD disc. The Dish DVR will not record to DVD?s.. You can pause live TV on either machine, but the Philips does a poor job of this. It?s easier to just hit the hit the record button on the Philips machine. Just hit the pause or rewind or skip back buttons on the Dish DVR. It starts recording any show you watch and keeps an hour in memory if you don?t change channels. If you change channels, it starts over. This feature doesn?t work if you are recording two shows.. The Philips unit looks good, about an 8 or 9 out of 10. The Dish unit looks terrible, probably a 0 or 1 out of ten. It even has the DTVPal TV emblem painted permanently all over the top of the unit. The Dish unit even has a satellite card sticking out the front of it. They didn?t even put a door over it like on their satellite units. They evidently use this to disable your machine if they want to?they disabled mine. The Dish unit has no buttons on it, not even a power button. It is controlled entirely by the remote control. The Philips unit has a power, play, stop and eject button on it. (I don?t know why they need a card. Cards are used to control your particular unit, either to limit service or bill you.). The Dish DVR lets you edit out channels you don?t want including sub channels like 8.4. The Philips DVDR is all or nothing. You either keep all of channel 8 and its sub channels or you delete them all.. The Philips has a very low quality remote. I hope it lasts a year. I bought another. The quality of the Dish remote is much better, but it?s not excellent.. I have one of the older Mitsubishi rear projection TV?s and it only has one 1080i component input. It also has 480 component input. Although the standard TV images are similar for both units, I have only used the Dish on 1080i input. It has a very good image, but not excellent. My seven year old Direct TV HD receiver (use only for over-the-air TV) has a better image.. I will continue this review if they let me.. Updated. on Jan 12, 2009.",862000,2011-07-24T23:38:28Z

1111,807,"As I first saw the Zune, I was totally interested in buying it. Next, I was thinking if it was worth the money. Now, I am happy that I bought it. The music feature is very excellent, giving you the album picture, and if you don't have it, it will have a color screen. If you want to, you can send it to any other Zune senders. Which leads me to the next feature, the wireless connection. I can not tell you how the connection is because no one else that lives near me has the Zune. The radio is decent, giving you an okay reception. I only have a few stations where they tell you the station and what you are listening to. What I use the most is the video feature. The feature is excellent and has a very clear viewing screen (3 inches). You can import all of your videos, songs and pictures from iTunes and Windows Media Player. Pictures are viewed just as well as videos are. Also, you can use your pictures as a background by selecting it when viewing it, and it says, place as background. The Zune Marketplace is very desirable to use, but it is very difficult to start with. The first thing that happened when we installed the program was that it imported all of my music, videos, and pictures from my iTunes, and you didn't have to press a button, you don't have to press import or anything. The hard thing about the Marketplace is syncing the video or song onto your Zune. You have to put it on you now playing list, then you go to the options section and you go to sync/sync now playing to _______ (your Zune name). The upsetting thing to me is that the Zune Marketplace only has songs, and no videos. Overall, this system is absolutely excellent and I hope to keep it for a long time..",864000,2014-02-15T17:39:48Z

I then tried to copy a large directory of pictures from the laptop (802.11a) to the SC101......hmm.....after about 5-10 minutes of copying, the laptop stopped copying....and the process showed up as not responding.

10338,452,"I wish that someone had written this for me before I had bought my new Nano 4G. Now, don't get me wrong.. it's pretty darn awesome...now that I am done setting the thing up. I wish someone had been more upfont with me about the time involved in converting the hundreds of songs we already had on our Windows XP computer stored in Windows Media Player. I was concerned that this would be a problem, but never really saw anywhere that properly prepared me for this. So here it goes, for you guys who were in my boat of uncertainty. THIS DEVICE IS DEFINITELY NOT A PLUG AND PLAY DEVICE. IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF MUSIC ALREADY ON YOUR COMPUTER, DO NOT EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO YOUR MUSIC IMMIDIATELY UPON PLUGGING IT INTO YOUR COMPUTER LIKE YOU WOULD WITH MANY OTHER MP3 PLAYERS- THE IPON DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT! I downloaded I-tune 8 which was very easy. I actually really like Itunes. However, it is supposed to check your computer for songs already on it and begin converting them to the Apple format. Don't worry, when you convert, you still keep original formatting in Windows Media Player (WMP). Well, 99.9% of my songs were NOT recognized. So, it took me an hour to figure out that you need to figure out exactly where on your computer your songs are stored. Mine was in the C: Drive under Documents and Owner, etc but you just have to search for a song by right clicking the start button and chosing search. Then type the name of a song and wait until it finds it. Once I finally figured it out, it wasn't hard. I started the manual converting which took a REALLY REALLY long time. Seriously, it takes as long as it would take to burn new CDs... just so you know what to expect. Then, once you get all the songs on you can search for album art. Don't be surprised if it doesn't find them all. BUT you can go into WMP and select individaul albums and do drag and drop of files for the art. The directions for that are on itunes. Finally, if you have songs that itunes says it can't convert because they are copyright protected (ie you downloaded them from another source, in my case Wal-Mart), you can still get them into Itunes by first burning them to a blank CD then opening the CD up in itunes. Worked like a charm!. Okay, that's really the worst of it. Once that is done you are smooth sailing and the Nano is SUPER cool. We all really love it and I really do like itunes 8. I downloaded a couple of cool games (only $4.99 ea) and got my daughter the Jonas Brothers video for $1.49 which she loves. I will definitely use itunes for video downloads, etc but I don't know if I will buy music from it because of the proprietary format. Especially now that I know how to download from another site and get around the copyright protection issue. I really like this player. We've only before had cheap ones that broke. I also love the playlists in this player so that as a family we can all have our music on it yet only listen to our own songs. Don't let some of these reviews scare you off because once you get the conversion done, it's a piece of cake. And if you don't have a bunch of stuff to convert, even better.. I hope this saves you some time. I mulled over the purchase for several weeks being nervous from some of these reviews. I am glad I finally took the plunge..",876000,2008-03-29T13:05:20Z
4233,973,"An overall winner. The street name audio is mentioned in an other review and in the specs. I just get turn directions, distances etc. but not street names. They appear on the screen but not on audio. Not a big deal, just wondering though.. Is this a new product. I could not find the 260 anywhere else on the net. Not even on the official Garmin site. Anyone have an info on this please post it. I will check regularly.. I got mine at staples. It began around $450, dropped to $399, dropped again to $350 and ended up at $299.. I bought mine at $350 and when I visited the store a few days later noticed the reduction to $299, spoke to the manager who very graciously reduced my bill by $50 so I actually paid $299 which I regard a good buy for this fine product..",877000,2008-09-26T23:35:00Z
19879,754,"The review of Lori Grunin is a disappointment. This is a review of a salesman, not a photographer, most likely a salesman of a different brand (e.g. Canon). I doubt Lori Grunin takes any pictures herself.. only 6 megapixel -- It is enough for an entry level camera. I have D200 with 10 megapixels and D40 with 6 megapixel, and I take most pictures with D40 now.. slow kit lens -- for the price of the camera ($570) it is an EXCELLENT lens. Canon's expensive cameras (over $1200) includes a worst lens kit than D40.. no automatic sensor cleaning -- none of the professional dSLR includes automatic sensor cleaning. Only few of the cheap dSLR includes it, just as a sales point.. control scheme ban be awkward - D40 has EXCELLENT (for the price and size) ergonomics, menus and controls. I do not know what she means by that.. occasionally slow focus -- I have not seen that. It has only three focus points, but that is a PRO for an entry level simple camera.. Again, the reviewer is most likely a salesman of a different brand.. I give it 10 point since I think it is an excellent camera for the prize..",878000,2012-02-10T11:04:43Z

11200,746,"Ok, this is concentrating on the Bluetooth Functionality.. Because Garmin choose the Parrot CK5000 chip instead of the Parrot CK5050 series chip, you won't be able to listen to your MP3s in stereo with the quality it deserves. You may find, like I and many others, that your music will sound hissy and distorted. It's so bad it gives me a headache. Being a motorcycle rider, the idea of hands-free operation with Bluetooth along with listening to my music with Bluetooth was appealing. However, the sound quality for MP3s does not cut it.. You CAN get stereo sound from the base output jack, but then you lose hands-free.. Firmware updates won't fix the issue.. It's notable to point out on the positive that linking a phone and a headset to the unit works great.. Also, the unit has tried to take me down one-way roads when it calculates routes..",880000,2014-06-06T14:59:24Z
13635,712,"Overall the Torch is an excellent device. The keyboard is what I've come to expect from a Blackberry after coming from a Bold 9000. This is my fourth Blackberry and their capacity for connectivity and messaging has not dwindled in the least. The touch screen allows for an experience unattainable for most Blackberry users (excluding Storm users of course) whiel the physical keyboard allows for comfortable keying in of long emails, essays, and anything else you might need to write up on the go. The browser is an absolute godsend especially after having three different Blackberries with mediocre browsers. The Torch loads pages a bit slower than the iPhone 4 and various Android devices, but fortunately this slight delay should not phase most users as it is only a couple seconds difference at worst. The inclusion of OS 6 introduces universal searching and various views (All, Favorite, Frequent, Media, etc) which is a welcome addition for organizing apps, contacts, and files on the Torch. My only qualm with this is the present inability to create custom views which I hope is a feature that will be present on future OS updates. Note that all my comments reflect upgrades to ANY of the leaked operating systems. The OS version on board at the time of launch was iffy at best and suffered from lag. If you want a device that is perfect out of the box this may not be right for you. The same holds true if you would like to upgrade your OS, but are incapable of doing so (have a Mac or are technologically impaired). I'm currently running version .246 and it is absolutely excellent. You will have no regrets if you upgrade your OS. Most dedicated Blackberry users will have no problem with the Torch and will have few qualms or regrets about purchasing one..",881000,2014-06-20T13:01:27Z

19835,488,"The iPod Touch has pros, cons, and features I admire. One pro of this iPod is the number of songs it can hold; on eight GB iTouch can hold 1,750 songs. More pros are, using the internet with a Wi-Fi connection, and buying apps from the app store, which also needs a Wi-Fi connection. Also, the battery lasts long and it doesn?t break easily, I have dropped my iTouch many times and it still works perfectly. There aren?t a lot of cons but there are a few. You need a Wi-Fi connection to use the internet, and sometimes you can?t find one. Also, the screen gets dirty too quickly. My favorite features are the apps, YouTube, and the number of songs it can hold.

I played the video back through the component video cable supplied with the camera, through my AV tuner and into my TV with no issues. I plan on buying a mini-hdmi to hdmi cable soon. I haven't downloaded to my computer yet, but don't plan to do to much editing at this point. I usually tape short snippets and string them together anyway when playing back, so I figure the software issues ought to iron themselves out by the time I get around to doing any of that....tough to do with my schedule.

3978,534,"The qwerty keyboard takes a bit of getting used to. After using it for about 3 weeks I can feel my sliding mechanism getting looser, so much that it will pop open slightly on its own.. All the side buttons suck. The camera button is too flimsy and loose, the volume rocker is too small. The worst is the lock/power button which is hard to depress and find on the phone.. There have been several occasions where I will be dropped in the middle of a call. I have set the phone to make a sound when calls start or end, and it doesn't play it when the calls are dropped. It can get quite irritating when you're in the middle of a conversation.. The battery life on this phone is ok at best. I really use it for texting, occasional facebook/internet/email, and some voice calling. At first the battery would last half of the day. Literally from 7am to Noon. After doing some research and finding how to dim the display and use task killers etc, I've gotten the battery to last an entire day... at best. This means from 7am to 7pm without charging... this isn't terrible, but I would much rather have it last until 10 or 11 pm... Even though I've finally gotten used to the keyboard, I found the software a little clunky. I'm ultimately planning on trading this in for a DROID Incredible..",887000,2011-04-13T14:54:16Z
19486,968,"I have no problem with the verticle design. I have gotten used to it.. OK this is the low down. This camera provides great video at 1440x1080 in HDV format. Apparently Canon has a 1920x1080 CMOS and then (SCALES DOWN!) Just like Sony to meet the HDV format of 1440x1080. Uug! How stupid!. On the positive side, Adobe Premiere CS3 supports 1440x1080 video well. That software does not even support out of the camera 1920x1080. However, I think there might be a trick using the HDMI port if the video can be sent directly from the CMOS to an HDMI card in the computer without being processed by the camcorder. For this reason I am now looking at a camcorder with HDMI (such as the HV20). With the Black Magic Design HDMI card, it might be possible to get real 1920x1080 video off of one of these cameras. I am not sure at what point the video is scaled down by the camera for the HDV spec. If the video can be pulled off at 1920x1080 then it could be dropped onto the Adobe Premiere timeline as 1920x1080 sequential images (like the idea behind motion JPEG) and then we are set! Real HD 1920x1080 video! The camera can already do it but the folks at SONY keep screwing up the works with their HDV and now their AVCHD. Why don't you all just stop the crap and give us our 1920x1080 video and we will determine how to process it once we have it? AVCHD H.264 is a great encoding format (Blu-ray, etc.) But for true editing you need sequential images that are NOT INTERLACED! ALL of these cameras are interlaced and therefore NONE of them give true 24p (non interlaced images). That is the problem! Believe it or not the cheapie cameras that use motion JPEG come closer to giving us what we really need as editors. However, the most promising idea is HDMI out of the camera into HDMI port in the computer using Black Magic Design's software to create sequential images. That is what I am going to try next. Canon and Sony only want to sell logos to unsuspecting consumers that are caught up in the compression craze when in fact the most serious compression should come after editing on the timeline NOT BEFORE!. And to sell a 24p consumer camcorder when it CAN NOT do 24p because of interlacing is misguided! Shame on you Canon (HV20). It is now almost 2008 and we are still using interlaced camcorders that were developed for television years ago. Let's get with the times..",888000,2010-09-04T01:15:02Z

A lot of them review based on what they've read on the news instead of reviewing based on actually using the phone. If I didn't have to offset the ridiculous reviews I'd actually give the iPhone 3G an 8/10.. I was a Blackberry user before and although I do miss some things about my BB, I couldn't say that I would trade my iPhone 3g for it. Although the iPhone doesn't support MMS and copy and paste, I'm ok with that. The revolutionary internet browsing capabilities and App Store alone (amongst many other wonderful things) make this phone a great device. Some have reviewed that this phone isn't perfect.....and tbh, what phone is?!? There's always going to be something new and better that not every phone can keep up with.. I've had this phone for 3.5 days now, and I can say that it's been the best phone I've had (just a slight edge over my blackberry). There are many other wonderful phones out there who don't get as much hype but that's not Apple's fault.. If you're looking to buy this phone, then I highly recommend it. Although society isn't always correct, most of the time they are and there's a reason why there's such a big hype around this product. I didn't get the iPhone because of the hype, I got it because it syncs better with my Mac. If Blackberry synced with my Mac a lot better (because Pocketmac sucks) then I probably would have stayed. However, now that I have the iPhone, I'm glad I did take the plunge.. Sure, it's short on some basic features......but EONS ahead in others.

6134,345,"G2 or BlackBerry? After using BlackBerries for 9 years, I thought it was time for a change. I was bored. Bought the G2 the week it came out ? and returned it a week later. It is a fantastic phone, don?t get me wrong, but it has one major flaw: the inability to maintain the confidentiality of data when syncing.. The G2 only allows syncing the phone with an exchange server. You cannot locally download contacts or calendar data to your phone. It is strongly suggested using Gmail (it?s a Google phone!!!) but any exchange server does it. I have a lot of highly confidential client data in my contacts and syncing with the ?cloud?, Gmail or not, is unacceptable. Therefore, the phone became useless and I had to return it. It would be helpful if T-Mobile becomes more detailed when suggesting one can sync with Outlook. You can only sync with Outlook via the cloud, not directly. HTC seems to offer sync features for some other phones (including Android devices) but not for the G2.. Syncing with exchange servers or Yahoo or Hotmail works extremely well. It is fast and accurate.. An Android annoyance is the tiny email fonts, which cannot be changed (unless somebody writes new and complete email software, which will happen at some point as Android is an open platform). People over 45 definitely need glasses to read emails.. As RIM missed integrating the business and fun crowd, Android and HTC make the same mistake, just from the other side. Guess who seems the G2?s target group? When texting, the comma can be found on the second page of the screen keyboard but the ?:-)? is on the main page. The typical G2 user apparently finds texting in sentences uncool and instead expresses himself through faces.. On many other issues, however, the phone is great! 4G is super fast and the browser works great (you can have several pages open). Live streaming from YouTube, for example, seems as fast as on an office computer. This depletes the battery very quickly, though. The G2 is very stable and NEVER crashed. However, I did not download many outside applications. Android seems to have issues with the compatibility of older software and the new 2.2 operating system. The open platform framework (which in principal I am a big fan of) seems to have serious limitations if existing software becomes outdated with the introduction of a new OS version.. Wireless (including N) works great although more complicated encryptions are not captured. WiFi calling does not work, though.. Oh, yes, the phone function? The phone actually works great. Excellent reception and very good sound.. So, without the confidentiality concerns, the G2 would get 5 stars. Overall, I am back to my boring BlackBerry. It works..",912000,2013-07-27T17:00:57Z

Its pretty solid, ive dropped it a few times and it didnt break nor had any problems with the controls.. its sad that we dont have a recently added playlist, so when we've added some new songs, we have to look through the WHOLE LIST of songs which can be annoying when you have nearly 2000 songs.... after pressing power, we have to wait for about 15 seconds for the mp3 to load, and im a pretty impatient person.. you can add songs to a GO LIST but you cant create a new list! or atleast i dont know how since the user guide is screwed up!!. Now, the go list is slow, the songs are not in alphabetical order but in order in which u added them, which is annoying because it is long to look for a song in a 200 songs list in which they are not placed in alphabetical order.. now, the videos and picture options are great, the quality of diplay is amazing, but a cool feature they could add is creating a slideshow for a song. im very disappointed that you cant put one of ur own picture as a background.... the install cd has a program named sansa media converter where u easily slide pictures and videos so they can convert them into ur mp3, but i had problems with this software.. not working very well, had trouble converting videos, and ended up not being able to convert ANY video for some unknown reasons....",913000,2011-01-22T08:58:40Z
17719,451,"ps3 slim and 360 elite are both priced at 299.99, but the better value is with the ps3 because of the extra features it comes with, that would cost you at least two hundred more dollars for the 360 to have (wifi, rechargeable controllers, online gaming, etc). In survey conducted by GAMEINFORMER magazine in the august 2009 issue, over 50% of 360's will fail on you while the ps3 is at a mere 13%. The ps3 also now has something that it didn't have before, and that's a reputable amount of games, that are also on the 360 like (Call of Duty, Bioshock, etc.) as well as their own exclusives most of which are considered by many reviewing websites to be editors choices (little big planet, metal gear solid 4, infamous, killzone 2) and the exclusives list will actually keep building with future releases of God of War III and Heavy Rain to name a couple. Although Bluray is fairly new it did win the format war and is projected to be the future of multimedia disk, you have to admit that being able to watch high def movies, granted that you have an HDTV, is an awesome feature to have at your disposal. Transfering media to your ps3 is also very easy, as you can put media on a flash drive and the ps3 can copy it and put it in the appropriate category (music, video, pics). Overall, you get more bang for your buck with a much more reliable system..",914000,2013-04-26T14:08:55Z
14323,923,"I love this camera! Just bought it about a month ago and have had several occasions to use it. It takes great pics, some better while on manual, so you can make use of all the great settings, such as: inside, pets, nighttime, fireworks, snow. The pics are very clean and crisp, and the movie option is pretty cool - you can take short movie clips and e-mail them!. You'll definitely need an additional memory card and an extra battery (both easily and cheaply purchased on eBay). I also got a card reader, so no need for cords and loading the software onto every computer.. I bought the camera (brand new) and all the accessories (carrying case, memory card, cleaning case, small tripod, card reader) on e-Bay for $239. Great buy!. I've read several reviews where people mention being concerned about scratching the screen. I found some screen protectors on eBay and they work perfectly; and they don't distort the LCD screen at all. Just search: canon sd600 protector OR guard. They were $1 + S&#38;H and well worth the price. No further need to be super careful about simple scratching, dust and finger marks.. Overall, a great camera!!!. Highly recommended!!!.",915000,2013-06-26T06:01:20Z

Since I could buy no extra supplies along the way and even electricity was seldom available I brought a total of 64 GB memory plus the larger battery. The results were a camera that delivered great quality pictures with enough memory and battery life to last a prolonged period of time. The small size of the camera allowed me to easily carry it in my backpack or even in a pocket. So, I'd recommend the camera for 'off the beaten path' activities!.",917000,2009-07-21T07:41:33Z

5331,756,"I am rating this brand new 2007 model of theirs an 8 mainly when taking into consideration the price based on my reasearch and experience. Only open question might be how reliable it will be longer term but that goes for just about anything.. I spent hours comparing specs/features, reviews, and prices of other 1080p LCDs in the $1000 price range and I kept coming back to this one. I actually first bought the Sony 37 KDL 720p Rear Projection but returned it because we could not stand the cooling fan noise and the fact the bulb life was rated at 8,000 hours ($150 to replace it) and the screen door effect was not much fun either on SDTV. I almost bought the 42 Vizio VU42FHDTV but picture quality seemed less vivid (it was connected to a Toshiba upscaling 1080i Dvd player showing Happy Feat movie at Costco) and Vizio's speakers are very weak and hollow sounding. Plus a lot of folks on the forums were having issues w/ the Vizio's for what it's worth. This Westy has a 10w subwoofer included and a 5 band equalizer built-in and several custom sound setting to choose from.. It looks like Westy has tried to listen to their critics of the past and made efforts to improve some things such as their On-screen Menu GUI is nicer and more user friendly and they have more adjustments to be made to settings. You may not know this but under one of the menu drop downs (Settings) is a more advanced Video section (Calibration) where you can play with Dynamic Contrast, 3d Comb Filter, and some other things people have complained Westy's did not have in the past as far as I can tell.. A couple of small things would be the black levels are hard to get right so far without sacrificing some brightness/quality. Blacks get a little washed out sometimes depending on source content. DirecTv Remote Control range and angle is a bit suspect. One must be almost straight on to the TV and within about 8 feet from what I find so far. Also, their picture scaling options are a bit limited and Fill Mode makes things a bit stretched when watching of course non HD content like a regular DirecTv 4:3 broadcast but i have seen other TV's like the Sony I returned for other reasons do a bit better job of the scaling.. We are quite happy just to watch Non HD content in Standard screen Mode (4:3) becuase the clarity is more defined yet picture is still big enough as this is a 42 Tv after all. This TV remembers your scaling mode based on your input mode.. Summary: Anyone considering a Flat Screen 1080p LCD in the $1,000 price range should give serious consideration to this one for its solid job of picture quality and features and i could not find a better value out there at the time of my purchase.. I can't wait to see how CNET reviews this one! Hmmm, wonder if I should have waited.. Thanks, Steve from Northern Virginia.",919000,2008-12-31T10:49:56Z

Sound quality is the best. people have the opinion that ipods have poor sound quality. I have had many mp3 players nothing work with the ease that all ipods have. The 4th gen nano just take portability to the next level. Can't wait till the accesories get rollin out for this little gem. One last thing the shake to suffle music is just awsome!!

I don't have cable or satellite service; I rely on broadcast signals to get my HDTV. I live near Chicago; I installed a high-quality roof-top antenna and am extremely pleased about the reception and the picture I receive. I tend to agree with the reviewer about how the set may perform better at 720p than at 1080i, but the picture at 1080i is still fine, if not fantastic.

USB speeds are 22MB writes, 25MB reads -- these are about 25% faster than my original, USB-only Drobo.. The reworked fan and cooling grills make this dead quiet. Even doing a prolonged Time Machine backup I couldn't hear any fan noise.. I think its a sign of sloppy work or bias that the reviewer mentions NOTHING about FireWire on a Mac.

19763,936,"Bottom line is this is the best phone ever. I have had mine for a month now. I had the Instinct before and I HATED it! I wanted a touch screen and at that time, the instinct was one of the better ones out for Sprint. I could not text on it which frustrated me to all heck as all I do is text. The phone would freeze anyways I could go on and on about how I hated my previous phone. SO I finally upgraded and it was between the Hero and the Moment. I was worried about having another touch screen for texting that was the only thing that had me torn. I fell in love with the Hero just from playing around for a few min. I have owned it for a month now and have to say I LOVE IT!! Texting is so easy I just use the T9 feature and I am good to go. The phone is so organized and you can put apps where you like so they are easy access for you. I really could go on and on about how great this phone has been. I am truly truly happy with my choice. Anyone worried about texting on this phone take it from me I am a HUGE text person and I have had no problems. I have also ready that the screen stays on while on a call which causes the phone to hang up for push buttons. I have not had that problem my phone goes to a black screen during a call. If you want a phone that does everything for you and then some and that you can make fun, this is the one for you!!! Good luck to all of you in search of a great phone.

3050,429,"I purchased this phone June 9th without doing much research. My prior phone was a 3-4 yr. old basic LG flip. I truly lucked out as this phone is a marvel. I wanted something that would combine a cell with the features I liked about my old Palm for contacts and calendaring. Because I couldn't afford the data/subscription charges associated with a Blackberry and not open to switching to AT&#38;T for an iPhone, I have found the enV Touch with the VPak pricing a good alternative.. I appreciate the CNET review and the submitted reviews by readers because I've learned much about the phone - even after reading the owner's manual! So thank you all. After reading about the price drop that occured just two days after purchasing the phone, I called Verizon as suggested and got $50 credited to my account.. I have been an existing Rhapsody customer for 5 years, but did not use it to sync to an external device. I called them up to negoiate a better price than the $15/month that Verizon was offering for VCast music, which is the same thing. I was already paying Rhapsody 9.95/month (I pay 1 year in advance, all at once, to get that price) and was able to get the Rhapsody to Go (right to transfer to several external devices) for just two more dollars a month.. Negatives: As stated, the browsing is tricky and kind of slow to respond, but enlarging the screen via zoom helps. I'd love to try the VZ Navigator, but can't justify the additional cost at this time. I hope they drop the prices on the games, and create apps &#38; games that are similar to the iPhone's. Many of the menus are too complicated - you have to click and click and search and search. Notes are a good example - this is an app I use a lot and would love for it to be more readily available and better written. Calendar is ok - again a lot of clicking to set up just one entry. Contacts, which is important to me (remember I'm replacing my Palm) should have the ability to add a second line to the name for a business, like Dr. John Doe, Meadowood Clinic and a line that accepts miscellaneous text.. Postives: I'm a newby when it comes to using a cell phone for retrieving email and web browsing. So despite what I said above re: browsing, it is still pretty cool and generally works. I have three email accounts set up and the access speed is excellent, the emails very readable. I have tried the mobile version of my internet banking and it works well. I have tried the mobile version of Facebook a few times and that hasn't been quite as successfull, but okay in a pinch. Camera is very good quality. I text a lot, using the internal and external screens. Keyboard is wonderful! It has nice interface with fun options like font styles and colors.. I'm extremely pleased with the music player. I own Bose ear buds and the sound quality is just as good as my iPod. Transferring songs from my Rhapsody client on my PC to the phone works very smoothly and quickly. The music player is probably my favorite feature.. I've had the phone for 2 1/2 weeks now and it's getting easier to use as I learn my way around. Thanks again for all the reviews as I've learned much from each of you. :). I appreciate the CNET review and.",937000,2009-07-27T18:27:58Z

14618,773,"Coming from someone that has had Verizon, TMobile and Cingular/AT&#38;T, and a plethora of phones along with that (including Blackberry's, Sidekicks, Palms, LGs, and Samsungs) I can honestly say this is the best and most functional phone I have ever had. Its also one of the best Multitasking phones I have ever used as well (second up is the Sidekick) I really do love everything about this phone, the contact sync with Facebook and Gmail, the giant touch screen, and they keyboard. Yes, the keyboard feels flat and weird at first. You WILL press 2 keys at once a lot on your first day because of this, but after a day or two's use it becomes a lot easier and you find your sweet spot with the phone. The browser is incredibly fast. The default browser has Tap to Zoom, not Pinch to Zoom... but there is a browser on the Android Marketplace that supports Pinch to Zoom. (Dolphin Browser).. The app store is growing, and there are a lot of useful apps on there. I love how the store is set up as well. Apps/Games/Verizon When you make the selection it goes to Top Paid, and then Top Free, and Just in. Great organization. When you select an app, before downloading and installing you can read about it and see user comments on whether or not they like it, and their ratings. As soon as you download it you can rate it and comment it yourself for others to see. Text messaging is fast and organized (because its threaded messaging... Messages organized by contact). When you play around with the phone you find so many new things.. Like when you click on a Contact's picture a little bar comes up that shows their facebook status, and a bunch of options that you can perform like Text, email, call, look at their profile via facebook app, or Instant Message..

You get free online gameplay, a Blu Ray player, wifi, and li-on batteries in the controllers, and the ability to upgrade the HDD. On top of this Sony has the best exclusives coming out in the next 12 months. Gran Turismo 5, Uncharted II, Heavy Rain, Ratchet &#38; Clank Future: ACiT, MAG, God of War III, Agent, The Last Guardian. Seriously - compare this with the Xbox 360 where you have Forza 3 and Halo: ODST as the big exclusives for the next 12 months.. The Xbox 360 is over priced. $100 for wifi. $50/yr for online gameplay, $15 for a rechargable battery kit, and then the overpriced HDD kit that they release at $100 and 180 every few years. On top of all of that once the warranty is out and Microsoft wont repair your console for free you will have to pony up the $200 for an arcade system or all your games and controllers will become worthless. Every single person I know who owns a 360 has had to send it in to MIcrosoft at least one time.. In my humble opinion you would have to be out of your mind to buy a Xbox 360 over a PS3 unless ALL of your friends are on the 360 and you have no interest in Blu Ray..",941000,2010-05-15T11:41:54Z
12960,937,"Netflix and Roku really know what they are doing: this $100 Player easily hooks up to your TV and broadband/wireless Internet connection, and gives you high-quality, immediate access to everything in your Netflix Watch Instantly queue, at no extra charge. Installation and setup worked properly the first time, and most of the 10 minute setup was spent entering my wireless security ID through the on-screen keyboard.. Video quality on my 46 Sony LCD is similar to DVD quality: barely less good than a store-bought commercial DVD, at least as good as, if not better than, a 2-hour DVD recording of a digital cable channel. HD is not available yet, but they say the box can handle it via a (presumably free) Firmware update, when/if Netflix can offer Instant HD content.. You have to have a good broadband/wireless connection to use this, just as you do to use Watch Instantly on your computer or laptop. Reception was fine at 1.0 megabits/second; when I moved the Player and base station around to get 1.5 mps, I didn't see any difference. When they start offering HD content, I'll probably want to boost the signal strength on my Access Point.. I've read two kinds of reviews of this product: tepid ones from people who do not seem to have actually used it, and raves from almost everyone who is using it.. As of June, 2008, Netflix has about 10,000 Instant titles available, and few, if any, are new or recent releases. That's got to be a licensing issue, and like most business problems, it can be solved in time with money (pay the studios higher royalties, charge customers something for new releases).. For people like me, older movies and documentaries are of greater interest than new releases, so there's more than enough content already available to make this device a must-have..

Discs load quickly and I haven't experienced any playback issues.. I like the idea of wireless streaming (who doesn't?), though, like most wireless applications not designed by Apple, I ran into some trouble during setup, but it works as expected once that hurdle is overtaken -- no lag, no cutting out, no way to tell it's wireless (unless you have slow internet). I navigated the menu to the wireless setup, entered the network password, which wasn't particularly fun with a 22-digit, 0-9 and aA-zZ style password and only the remote's directional pad and an on-screen keyboard to accomplish the task. Upon its first connection to the internet, it began downloading a firmware update. Of course, after it downloaded, installed and rebooted, it reset the wireless password and I had to re-enter it. Pandora and YouTube are great streaming functions, so far. Netflix requires membership and their lack of titles was disappointing; haven't explored Blockbuster.. I think it's a good value, second-tier player..",943000,2009-05-31T03:14:14Z

The phone started to not alert me when I got a text message. So I thought maybe it's just acting up so I shut off the phone and turned it back on. The alerts started to work but a couple hours later it started to do it again. Then it finally stopped sending me alerts all around which means no alert tone, no incoming box that shows the texter, or the little envelope at the top right hand. I called in T-mobile in with my problem and they had me hard reset the phone. It started to work like the day I got it . But then a couple more days and it started the process of not alerting me all over. I took it in and got a new one thinking it was just that phone and it had a defect. But then my second one did the same thing. T-mobile then sent me another phone 2 weeks after I received my second phone. I just received my 3rd phone about 2 weeks ago and I just got off the phone with them sending me my 4th replacement phone for having the same exact issue.. If I wasn't such a heavy texter it wouldn't bother me so much but seeing has most people do communicate through texting it's needed to be alerted. It's a shame such a nice phone gets brought down but a defect in the system. Hopefully the upgraded version of this phone won't have this defect and that we can enjoy all the things the Nokia 5230 has to offer..",944000,2009-03-30T19:17:41Z

The only thing i've seen that would be a possible con was the maps not being totaly up to date..

7412,510,"I bought this camera to replace my old Fuji S3000 6x zoom 3.2mp. I still didn't feel ready for a D-SLR (too much camera for my abilities and much too big to want to carry anywhere), but I wanted a big zoom (for me, prohibitively expensive option on a D-SLR), so no pocket camera made the grade for me. After reading reviews, handling and comparing this and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ7K (a lot cheaper, similar features and quality), I bought this one. I love it. In auto mode, I'm very happy, and taking manual mode pics are a slow but steady learning experience (which I knew going into the purchase, but was something I wanted to experience and grow with...I wasn't looking for a cheap point and shoot). I have to keep the supplied manual with me in my camera case for more creative shots, but I'm having a lot of fun with it. So many features if I care to use them, and auto if I don't! Personally, I'm glad there's no date-stamp to turn off....I hate them and have no need for them, but I understand others complaining about the lack of it if they use it on other cameras. Another big factor for me was the AA battery usage...I just did NOT want a proprietary expensive battery to purchase as an extra, so I spent the extra money for the better reviewed camera, and I'm quite happy 2 months into ownership. It feels very solid, love the black vs. the prior version's silver, love the flipping (but small) LCD. I haven't even tried the movie feature yet, but I've read it's fun! Plus, I liked the option of getting an adapter tube to use optional lenses, which I've done and enjoyed. And now the price is falling...I'd definately buy one again!.",947000,2011-07-07T08:31:43Z

8371,736,"So originally I bought this so I could just listen to my iTunes library, which included TV Shows and Movies I bought; on my TV and really nice surround sound system. Heres my story:. One day I was just sitting there and thinking how nice itd be never to put another DVD into my DVD player. I was messing around with a couple solutions, including converting my DVDs for play back on my 360, but Ive never been a huge fan of the .wmv file format. The quality is horrible and it wont support huge files (360), another big turn off.. So I decided that I would give the AppleTV a try. To my amazement, it supported a good quality (not as high as I would have liked) conversion from my DVDs. I quickly became aware that the Apple TVs hard drive wont support my new needs for mass storage. So I bought an external hard drive for my computer and stored my movies on there and stream them to my AppleTV. Now I know this isnt what I wanted to begin with, but the solution works great. No problems, streaming occurs fast, and it caches the movie Im watching.. More Storage Please:. What would be nice for the AppleTV of the future? Higher bit rate for files, larger file support, at least 1TB hard drive (seriously 40 or 160---weak!), and an easy solution for the masses to convert there DVDs for AppleTV.. Bottom Line:. If you want iTunes like interface through your home theater system and have movies youd like to digitize, then AppleTV is one of the best solutions Ive used. Itll bring your current iTunes Library to your home theater system, plus its looking as if Apple is trying to position its self as a digital movie renter for the masses. Well see if they actually gain titles and studios to back that initiative. Im impressed with this product thus far!.",954000,2012-04-08T02:11:42Z

Make sure to do a back-up of your files first on DVD/CDs to install later. You will have to reinstall all your programs but it will be a much smoother move than doing the upgrade.

I purchased this camera to take to Africa, so the AA batteries were important since there won't be reliable electricity to recharge. I'm a former professional photographer, so I want the creative freedom this camera provides. The image stabilization makes up for the slow flash recycling in some ways, since in many low-light situations you won't necessarily need a flash for sharp images. I would recommend picking up a 4GB SD card so that you have adequate image storage. If you are familiar with Canon's user interface, it's pretty easy to learn how to use the A590's features.

I bought this phone with my new verizon wireless contract, and at first was amazed at it's price value.

I'm not exaggerating --literally 0 bar, or in other words, can't use the phone at all or able to receive texts hours late. I thought it was because I had a faulty phone, so Verizon sent me a new one. I still had the same problem.. You might be thinking it's because of the neighborhood that I live in, and I thought so too. However, I had bad reception at my workplace, and at my home that I live in during weekends. Verizon customer service even assured me that the area I was in should not have any reception problem but they would go ahead and send a specialist to check the area.. It's been 3 weeks and I've heard not a single update, I'm paying about $90/month for nothing, and the worst of all, I can't use my phone.. As my last resort, I'm literally moving to a different city (closer to my workplace) in hope of being able to make phone calls. This phone has caused me so much trouble that I'm even thinking about paying a couple hundred dollars just to end my contract early..

I advanced the file to the same point and noticed that the files were not playing at the same speed.. The Fuze player was gaining approximately .75 seconds for every one minute of playback on the computer. The effect is subtle but noticeable if you play the files back simultaneously or consecutively. I wasn?t sure which was accurate so I compared the results to a stopwatch and several other portable players (Creative, Samsung, iPod and the older Sansa Express). Every other player and every program on my PC (Media Player, iTunes and Real Player) played back the files accurately.. I contacted SanDisk and confirmed that I had the latest firmware and reformatted the Fuze. The Fuze also has a blunt playback speed option and I confirmed that it was set to Normal (as opposed to Slow or Fast). I also confirmed that the bit rates were all above 32kbps. SanDisk told me to exchange the device with the retailer.. I did and the new Fuze has the same problem. I then got a manual firmware upgrade from one of SanDisk?s technical reps and again reformatted the Fuze and even re-downloaded the files from their original sources before loading them on the device.. The Fuze still gains approximately .75 seconds for every one minute of playback on any other device for mp3 files. WMA files playback nearly accurately, in that they lose approximately one second for every ten minutes of playback compared to any other device.. The Clip loses approximately .75 seconds for every one minute of playback on any other device for both mp3 and wma files.. The Express plays accurately.. I even sent the files to a SanDisk tech rep and he acknowledged that the files don?t play accurately. He said that for the Fuze and Clip, the hardware could not accommodate all the variations in files that I might encounter. I expressed dismay that all the other manufacturers seem to have solved this problem and even the older Express plays accurately.. Even more shockingly he said that his engineers were working on a new firmware upgrade to be released next year but they were not confidant that it would solve this problem. Additionally he said that, since SanDisk is moving more in the direction of developing ?Slot? players it would probably never solve the problem on the hardware side.. Other than that, I prefer the form factor design, navigation and interface on the Sansa devices to all others except the iPods. I?d recommend that they get rid of the separate home button by merging this function to the central button for holds of more that two seconds.. The features available are better than any other device for the money. I appreciate the ability to record FM transmissions and the additional micro card memory slot. FM reception is also better than any other device I?ve tried. The sound quality is second only to the Creative devices I?ve tried but better than iPod, Sony or Samsung (but stay away from the clumsy equalizer presets).. Obviously, I?m disappointed that the geniuses at SanDisk don?t care that their otherwise fine devices do everything well except the primary thing they were designed for..",988000,2010-07-05T10:27:50Z

14187,944,"Three years ago I purchase one of the first 52 LCD's made by Sharp (Aquios). With all the new technology that has circulated, I decided to purchase this TV and right away I have noticed a huge difference. I am very happy with the picture, options, and modern look the TV displays. There's nothing else like watching Blu-Ray on this television. The picture is very life like and brings butterflies to my stomach everytime I watch it. I've done alot of research before deciding to purchase this TV. I was able to negotiate the prices Amazon offered on their website with a Best Buy store next to my house under the condition that I purchased their calibration package for an additonal $299 (I paid $1699 for the TV). I purchase the Bose Lifestyle 35 and I couldn't be happier. The combination between the two items is stunning. The experience when watching a Blue-Ray is like watching TV for the first time. The only concern I have is that I have read reviews where the customer service from Samsung (In regards to this TV) sounds like it isn't the best. Now I'm concerned that if there is a problem with my TV I will have to fix it myself and I can only imagine how much that would cost. I'm wondering now if I should purchase the extended warranty Best Buy offers for an additoinal $250. I still have to wait another month before Best Buy comes to calibrate my TV. Does anyone know the preferred setting to watch sports in HD on this television?.",990000,2014-04-27T23:01:11Z
16564,990,"I bought this camera b/c of the awesome reviews it had....and I feel like it was one of the best investments in a camera possible. I feel like I know camera's pretty well. I'm an ameteur photographer and this is def. a good choice for a digital point and shoot.. If you understand even just a little how to work the exposure controls on a camera (which depond on the setting of the room you're in) then you'll love this camera. The exposure controls on this camera are soooo easy to figure out. ANYONE could do it.. The best thing is, even if you're not a buff on exposure controls, JUST SET IT TO AUTO! and it will auto adjust to the environment and take the best pic.. This camera takes great photos and it's startup time is super fast which is an under-rated feature in Dig Cameras.. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to printing quality. And for a point-and-shoot, it doesn't get any better than this. To get better quality, you'd probably have to buy a high end pro camera.. Bottom line: if you know how to set the exposure controls to the room you're in or if you're outdoors...(and with this camera it's super easy), then you will be pleased with this camera.. Don't let the very few bad reviews stop you from considering this camera. Consider the fact that is recieved an EDITOR'S CHOICE and rating of 8.2!.",991000,2011-09-17T10:42:58Z
7174,442,"-Pros. *Touchscreen is very responsive and so are the main buttons on the bottom.At the beginning the touchscreen had too much trouble reading what I typed but after a day of usage and I think of getting to feel being touched it works great!. *Keyboard is very nice and stylish and the keys are really good for typing. They aren't as good as the keys on the EnV2/3 or EnV Touch but they work well.. *Swype makes my typing much much faster and it is built in without having to download.. -Cons. *I have noticed that it lags too much when going from app to app and not using Task Killer.. *This bothers me too much because I listen to music on it a lot and I might just be doing that and it will crash and the screen wont respond no matter how long I wait and I just have to take the battery out and it is frustrating. Anyone know what might be the problem?. *Anyways, the camera is too grainy and not good quality...I can pretty much say the camera on my old EnV2 was almost the same or better than the Droid 2. But then again the camcorder looks amazing and much much better than my old phone. Anyone know why again?.",992000,2010-11-07T19:03:50Z
7244,388,"This is the nicest LCD tv I have ever seen. I recently purchased this tv and have been very impressed with it. The blacks are incredible and the colors are lifelike. The think design is impressive but the picture quality is what really takes the cake. One warning. This tv is VERY reflective. If you have windows that face your tv you need to make sure you can block out any light coming in or you will see reflections that can be distracting. Overall though a real winner and the best LCD to date.. Updated. on Feb 12, 2010.",993000,2013-05-27T04:41:51Z

It also told us that the mall we were trying to find was on the left and it was actually on the right. By the time you realize you're in the wrong lane it's too late to get over and you have no choice but to make a U-turn somewhere. Overall this is a nice GPS system..",995000,2010-06-13T07:13:17Z

10319,807,"I recently had my business laptop die on me and replaced it with a Dell loaded with Vista Business. So far, I have had major time consuming issues with Outlook. I originally tried my Outlook 2000 which is not supported. Apparently this is because of a file called wab32.dll that was located in Outlook Express does not exist because OE has been replaced by Windows Mail. Now that I am loading in Outlook 2000 from the Office XP suite, I am getting all kinds of error messages and warnings from Vista that a program is trying to hijack my email addresses from outlook...and I most certainly don't have any viruses or anything! You would think that somewhere along the line, the designers would have realized that people coming into vista will be using Outlook 2000 or 2002, and they seem to have done NOTHING to bring these business users into this new platform.. Aside from that, the system isn't really very fast, which is surprising, and it seems to have an awful lot of thinking to do. I know Microsoft wants to create this totally new experience and the website claims like simplifying your business so you can have more fun! and others that are equally nauseating. Vista has provided me with no benefits thus far..",997000,2008-04-15T12:11:33Z
15645,465,"I got a G1 about 18 months ago because we had a T-mobile family plan and didn't want to switch. It was a decent workhorse and while I have a iPod touch and initially considered an iPhone I was glad I got a G1 because of the physical keyboard and the fact it meshes so well with Gmail and the other Google productivity tools are so much better than anything else I have ever used. On the other hand, when it came to fun stuff like music and watching movies the G1 wasn't even in the same class as my iPod Touch or a iPhone. The MyTouch slide is the best of both worlds. It has all the nice features of the G1 and Android but is fast, has excellent battery life a decent screen and has a software/hardware combination that plays music and movies was well as my IPod touch. I have only had it a few days but I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone. My only significant beef, and it is really with Android's architecture is the limited memory space available for applications..",998000,2009-09-23T12:31:47Z
1005,956,"Bottom line, it's the best player I've bought so far.. I mean, I just bought it because I love Creative, but I have to say, this is the best player by far.. I loved their Vision:M although it was my friend's, I just kept playing with it. But this tops it.. They kept the large 2.5'' screen which is absolutely beautiful. Pictures and movies look terrific on this screen. I'm glad they kept the screen size and put it into this very small and slim player, it makes it more pocket-friendly.. As expected from Creative, it has an array of features. It also supports AAC now, but I don't have those so I didn't really need it, but I know most people do. It supports many types of files which is great since you don't have to convert every single file into one file type. I've never had a problem with the program it comes with since it's pretty easy to use.. And something new from Creative, the SD card slot. I've never used those before, but they've proved to be quite handy for extra memory....not that 16GB isn't enough for me. I'm good with even just 4 or 8GB but just in case. I do watch a lot of anime shows so it was perfect for viewing those.. Oh and it has great battery life. One charge and I was listening and watching for two days. GREAT.. It is pretty affordable when you think about all the things that the player comes with and all its capabilities. I mean, I got this from Circuit City for about $170 (more or less) and that's really good for a 16GB player with this many features.. So I highly highly highly HIGHLY recommend this. I don't know how much I can stress it but it's absolute genius. I mean, unless you hate the controls, which I thought were good and pretty straightforward. I don't expect touch control or anything like that. Just easy-to-use tactile buttons.. SO GET THIS. NOW. XDDD.",999000,2014-03-11T11:39:15Z
