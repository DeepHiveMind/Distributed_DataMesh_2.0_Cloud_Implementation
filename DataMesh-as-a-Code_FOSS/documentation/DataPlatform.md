# Data Platform Infrastructure

The Data Platform Infrastructure consists of two parts

 1. The Core Data Platform with all the technologies for building the data products
 2. The Governance Data Platform which hosts the Governance related services for maniging the data products 

Both platforms have been generated using the [Platys](http://github.com/trivadispf/platys) toolkit.
